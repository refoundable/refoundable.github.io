    <p>John Anders is an entrepreneur. He started and runs Refoundable to support visionary founders in their mission to build enduring companies.</p>
    <p>Previously, he worked for a global early-stage venture firm, where he managed dealflow from over a dozen emerging economies, and reviewed hundreds of early-stage startups. He is known for mentoring early-stage founders on strategy.</p>
    <p>Before that, he organized and curated many conferences, hosting speakers ranging from C-level officers of billion-dollar startups in emerging markets, to the director of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, to founders and innovators, of whom one would later receive a $100k Thiel fellowship.</p>
    <p>He continues to look for new ways to accelerate science and technology innovation in the 21st century.</p>

      <li><div class="question-answer">
        <p class="bolded question">Why do we need technology innovation?</p>
        <p>Every century in recorded history without exception saw at least one catastrophic conflict. Today, we live in a world that can destroy itself many times over. We just cannot afford another major outbreak of violence.</p>
        <p>We can debate the specifics ad infinitum, but we can’t simply brush this problem away, or merely come to terms with it. We have to be the first to overcome it.</p>
        <p>If technology is defined as doing more with less, then it is the only effective way we can create abundance, prosperity, and security to guarantee the peace.</p>
        <p>Sadly, a lot of what passes for technology today is trivial, or worse, cynical. Real technology innovation goes so far beyond what came before it that we could never go back. In a word, real technology endures.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div class="question-answer">
        <p class="bolded question">Don’t all technology companies eventually decline?</p>
        <p>Nobody who’s lived through the demise of a technology company, or more broadly a boom market, will mince words about the carnage it leaves behind.</p>
        <p>We should not excuse or ignore the end of once bright careers or the destruction of capital any more than we should celebrate senility and death.</p>
        <p>Still, not every technology company can be saved. If you work for a stagnant company that isn’t even aware of its own decline, or perhaps already accepts it, you should leave now and do something new.</p>
        <p>The start of a great new venture gives you the biggest margin of freedom to begin a founding that is never truly finished. Great companies may not abolish decline, but they can delay it indefinitely.</p>
      </div></li>
      <li><div class="question-answer">
      <p class="bolded question">What makes a visionary founder?</p>
       <p>When a technology company stops reinvesting in new science and technology innovation, it begins to expect the future to look a lot like the past.</p>
       <p>At that point, the operational excellence of professional managers makes them the perfect fit to lead a company focused on making incremental gains, or looking to sell.</p>
      <p>Where visionary founders are very different is that they offer a specific vision of a future that radically breaks with the past. Indeed, to be inspiring, this vision must be difficult. To be valuable, it must be attainable.</p>
      <p>Great founders walk this tight rope by lifting the mission above wealth or status. They push themselves and their teams beyond the easy answers of business school, beyond reason itself at times, into the rarified air of faith and total devotion, where no hired help can break in and no grounded competitor can follow.</p>
