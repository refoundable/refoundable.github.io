      <h2>Reinventing is<br>harder than it looks.</h2>

      <h2>The end game is<br>just the beginning.</h2>
    </aside>
    <p>We have two foundational goals:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Accelerating science and technology innovation.</li>
      <li>Helping great founders build enduring companies.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For the better part of the 20th century, working at the bleeding edge of technology in places like Bell Labs, HP Labs, or Xerox Parc was a great way to meet these goals.</p>
    <p>The work these R&D centers pioneered gave us the first transistor, the cellular phone, communication satellites, solar cells, LED displays, laser printing, and so much more. More importantly, it helped to launch and sustain the computer revolution, changing the world forever.</p>
    <figure>
        <img alt="Invention of the first transistor at Bell Labs, 1948" src="/assets/img/buf.png" data-echo="/assets/img/mis-1.jpg">
      <figcaption id="cap1">William Shockley (seated), John Bardeen (center) and Walter Brattain (right) invented the first transistor at Bell Labs, 1948<span class="credits credits-blk">Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent</span></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Yet, the companies that pioneered these inventions never fully capitalized on what they created.</p>
    <p>As smaller startup ventures became the norm for taking these new technologies to market, people gradually began reducing their expectations of older technology companies, until they ceased to be the place where the&nbsp;future happens.</p>
    <p>We believe these reduced expectations have swung too far. We moved into a world where startup ventures alone are expected to innovate, and most founders build to sell, with less concern for what happens next. Innovation itself shifted from long-term to immediate gratification.</p>
    <p>It is no wonder then that over the same period, the rate of new science and technology innovation came to a sustained period of deceleration. Among the causes for the slow down, we submit, are practical limits to what problems can be solved when you can only take a startup as a starting point.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">1</a></sup></p>
    <p>To solve the biggest problems in the 21st century, we believe that mission-driven ventures led by visionary founders can create more value over the long run.</p>
    <p>These companies can have the clarity of vision, great ambition, and long time horizon requisite to take on the seemingly impossible.</p>
    <p>And for their gambits, they stand to be greatly rewarded. From 1997 through 2017, Apple and Amazon captured 1.7 trillion dollars in market value, in no small measure due to the insistence of their founders on thinking different.</p>
    <p>As two of the most valuable companies in the world, they prove that enduring companies are not defined by their first breakthrough.</p>
    <p>This, then, leads us right into the trillion dollar question: How can great companies keep reinventing the future?</p>

    <p>For decades, Moore’s law was relied upon to produce a doubling of hardware speed for the same cost every 18 months. The ambitious and relentless momentum of this project allowed the modern miracle of micro-processors to pervade every sector of the economy.</p>
    <p>It may be argued that the success of Moore's law was so complete that it made existing technology dramatically better without much need for additional innovation. As such, perhaps it’s no surprise that most new products could be best described as incremental improvements on&nbsp;the past.</p>
    <p>The next generation of iPhone may be twice as fast, but is it really twice as revolutionary as the original iPhone? These improvements may be important, even necessary, but they will never be enough to escape competition and move your company and the world forward.</p>
    <p>Often, many companies will claim to be working in secret on next-generation technology, only to come out with something incremental in the end. What might account for this shortfall?</p>
    <p>Perhaps one could begin by counting an elementary fact that often gets overlooked, that by calling it the next generation, these companies have already narrowed the definition of the technology to its last generation.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">2</a></sup></p>
    <p>To make an improvement by an order of magnitude or more, you must leave behind this inter-generational thinking altogether, and find a new way forward.</p>
    <p>This is enough to stop most companies in their tracks, as it stands outside the relative ease and certainty of past and present trends, so that the advantage goes to the few who are able to carry through to the end.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>When Tesla unveiled its prototype Model S in March 2009, three years before it went on production, few car makers used the lead time to ask some tough questions about what's in their future product pipeline.</p>
    <p>Their first wake up call came when the Model S debuted to universal acclaim, quickly turning into one of the best-selling luxury sedans around the world, and propelling Tesla’s brand to global preeminence.</p>
    <p>Ten years later, most car makers are still trying to catch up to the Model S of the last decade, while Tesla pulls out further ahead to new destinations.</p>
    <p>Next-generation products may pay off over the next year, but a single new breakthrough product will pay off over the next decade.</p>

      <p>We don't believe that the next-generation paradigm applies to revolutionary new products as they will often create their own new categories. Google was not the next-generation portal, but the first automated search algorithm. The original iPhone was not the next-generation pocket computer, but the first real smartphone.

    <p>If you can’t always stay ahead of the curve, what do you do? One theory has it that you should go out and buy other companies.</p>
    <p>Even so, when you’re late to the future, real bargains will be harder to find, and you’re far more likely to overpay. And keeping odd technology teams working in synergy together post-acquisition is never as easy as it's made out to be.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">3</a></sup></p>
    <p>What’s more, most acquisition deals fall through, so there are no guarantees that your bid will succeed.</p>
    <p>When Yahoo! offered to buy Google and Facebook early on for a billion dollars each, it was rebuffed both times. And while it did succeed in buying hip startups like Tumblr and Flickr, they were not enough to&nbsp;save it.</p>
    <p>As such, founders would do well to remember that relying on acquisitions to keep your company relevant can be dangerous. The best founders don’t sell.</p>

    <ol>
      <li id="fn3">
      <p>We do believe some acquisitions to be valuable, especially when product synergies are unusually strong and likely to last, or to avoid the prospect of protracted competition, but never as an excuse for a company to stop having bold new ideas of its own.<a href="#r3" class="fn-btn fn-btn-bot">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

    </aside>
    <p>Another management theory suggests letting innovative ideas percolate from the bottom up.</p>
    <p>Leave it up to small groups of smart people inside your company to work out what your company should build next, by freely running as many experiments as possible. This underlies much of what goes on inside corporate incubators today.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, what this theory manages to miss is that the most revolutionary products often start out as really awful and unpopular ideas.</p>
    <p>To succeed, they must survive first contact with more popular and better-sounding ideas inside the company, only to then face off against the internal resistance that can efficiently rob most original ideas of their energy before they’re fully formed.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>Only direct intervention from a leader who can shift priorities and show singular dedication to what is right, even if unpopular, will inspire the most talented people in the company to do the same.</p>
    <p>So in practice, running a portfolio with dozens of small projects can only distract you from the single biggest breakthrough no one is making.</p>

      <h1><a id="Competition">Competition</a></h1>
      <h2>Losers break in,<br>Winners break out.</h2>
    </aside>
    <p>It is easy to see competition as a shortcut to innovation. All you need to do is copy the best ideas other people have and keep a&nbsp;close race.</p>
    <p>The problem with this view is in treating improvement and innovation as equals.</p>
    <p>Had Apple continued to obsess about Microsoft as it did in the early 1990s, the Mac operating system may have kept improving, but in trying to win that race, Apple could never innovate its way into making the iPhone.</p>
    <p>The other extreme, A/B testing and asking users what they want, doesn’t work early on either. The search space is so large that you’ll end up depending on dumb luck, or more likely, running out of time before figuring out the answer.</p>
    <p>The most effective innovators repeatedly identify the unmet needs of their customers, and design entirely new products to meet them. As a bonus, the competition is far less likely to follow you down what seems like an unfashionable path until it’s way too late.</p>
    <figure>
        <img id="img6" alt="iPhone prototype development board, 2007" src="/assets/img/buf.png" data-echo="/assets/img/mis-6.jpg">
        <figcaption id="cap6">No Intel in sight on the original iPhone prototype development board, 2007<span class="credits credits-inl">The Verge</span></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>When Apple was looking for a chip to power the original iPhone, Intel didn’t have a mobile processor powerful enough to offer, as it was too focused on protecting its sizable lead in the PC market.</p>
    <p>This led Apple to take a second look at ARM-based processors, which matured since their first use in the Newton PDA, and could deliver by then the dedicated, low-power chip design the iPhone needed.</p>
    <p>Later on, as the full scale of the smartphone revolution came to light, Intel would spend the next decade trying to catch up on dedicated mobile chips, while ARM-based processors now power most of the world’s smartphones.</p>
    <p>Real innovation escapes the competition.</p>

      <h2>So obvious.<br>So unexpected.</h2>
    </aside>
    <p>One way to innovate is to invent something completely new. In their heyday, corporate labs could still make big bets on highly speculative research if it carried the promise of yielding new technologies.</p>
    <p>This was how the scientists and engineers at Xerox Parc could hand-build a computer machine in 1973 -- the Alto -- that was at least a decade ahead of its time. And they could wire 200 of these computers into a single network -- inventing Ethernet along the way -- to experience first-hand how the world would eventually come to work in the decades to follow.</p>
    <figure>
      <img alt="Alto computer at Xerox Parc, 1973" src="/assets/img/buf.png" data-echo="/assets/img/mis-7.jpg">
      <figcaption id="cap7">The Alto computer at Xerox Parc, 1973<span class="credits credits-inl">Parc</span></figcaption>
  </figure>
    <p>By working and programming in the future, they argued, you can invent the tools that will become necessary tomorrow, today.</p>
    <p>Indeed, they went on to invent the first object-oriented programming language, the modern graphical user interface, Ethernet networking, desktop publishing and dozens of other equally impressive technologies that made the personal computer revolution possible.</p>
    <p>Today, this kind of speculative research is seen by most technology companies as a risky long shot that would take far too long to pay off.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="r4" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">4</a></sup></p>
    <p>Instead, they prefer to approach R&D like a portfolio to be managed and diversified. So at any one point, they’re running a random number of small experiments, while diligently keeping track of the competition, and taking young startups on fishing expeditions to try to catch the last wave.</p>
    <p>It doesn’t have to be this way. Not every big innovation requires years of basic research in a lab. Indeed, the biggest commercial innovations have often come from the elegant integration of existing technologies together in surprising new ways.</p>
    <figure>
      <img alt="Apple II, 1977" src="/assets/img/buf.png" data-echo="/assets/img/mis-8.jpg">

  </figure>
    <p>In 2003, Amazon had a pressing need to provide its project teams with shared computing infrastructure services like databases, storage, and compute. Yet, it soon became clear to its leadership that many outside developers had a similar need for reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure.</p>
    <p>This became AWS, which in 2006 launched as the first provider of cloud infrastructure as a service, long before this was even a category, let alone a hotly contested one. Still, AWS remains Amazon’s most profitable business line to date.</p>
    <p>Paradoxically then, it’s more than likely that your own company may already know how to make its next big breakthrough, without fully realizing it.</p>

      <p>It would be nearly scandalous for any company today to pursue research on speculative new technologies that won’t be commercialized for 10 to 20 years, despite reaping the fruits of equally ambitious research that was done by more optimistic corporate labs in the past.

      <h2>The best endings<br>go on forever.</h2>
    </aside>
    <p>Looking at the decades ahead, it’s safe to expect many of their greatest innovations to come in all likelihood from new startup ventures.</p>
    <p>Yet, if these same startups are ever going to succeed in graduating to the ranks of the most valuable companies, they will need to discover how to keep reinventing themselves along the way.</p>
    <p>This challenge isn't reserved to startups alone. Should we also look forward to a peaceful and abundant 21st century, then the task ahead of us will be likewise to figure out how to reinvent much of our world anew.</p>
    <p>If nothing else, the sheer scale of the challenge suggests that we cannot simply rely on a never-ending stream of new startups and exits to save us.</p>
    <p>To overcome the tyranny of chance, we must also find new ways to support the most ambitious founders to build for the long term, helping their companies to keep on innovating for a long time to come.</p>
    <p>The life of ventures that do succeed can be measured in decades. That is enough time to offer their people long, productive careers inside. We should not accept to spend those careers incrementally.</p>
    <p>A single career may be long, but inside a company busy inventing the future, no job description lasts forever. To reinvent the future, we must begin by rethinking what we work on today.</p>

    <p>For our part, we choose to devote all our efforts towards helping visionary founders to build enduring companies with long time horizons.</p>
    <p>We have faith that this is both the right answer and the necessary counterweight to the glaring blindspot we see in the Silicon Valley religion of never-ending substitution.</p>
    <p>Some will wonder whether the success of such enduring companies would have a stifling effect on new startups.</p>
    <p>In practice, we find the reverse is true. When technology companies with substantial reach and scale fail to invest in ambitious long-term projects, they cease building the enabling technologies that give way to more startups. As Peter Thiel puts it, they become bets against the future.</p>
    <p>In addition, the challenges that enduring companies face are often so unique, that to the extent they resolve to take them on ahead of other problems, they will end up in a place that does not compete with startups at all.</p>
