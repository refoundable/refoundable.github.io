    <p>Something has changed for the better in Silicon Valley. As the balance of power has shifted in favor of founders, technology companies are staying private longer, and founders are keeping control of their companies.</p>
    <p>Many such founders are beginning to wrestle with the hard question of how to go about building a company that doesn't merely scale, but keeps on innovating for a very long time, in other words, a company that endures.</p>
    <p>Until now, there’s been very little said publicly on this question. Most startup advice is on how to start small and scale up, but what's it like to build a technology company that can last for the long run?</p>
    <h4 class="subhead">Forward Guidance</h4>
    <p>This interview series is the first public exchange we know of that hopes to provide contemporary answers to this most valuable question.</p>
    <p>We'll focus on four areas in particular that are of interest to enduring companies: R&D, product line expansion, vertical integration, and talent retention.</p>
    <p>We'll sit down with founders and innovators who offer exceptional insights in at least one of these areas. The interviews will be published here.</p>
    <p>Each interview will be announced ahead of time, giving you a chance to take part by sending us your questions, if any.</p>
    <div class="notice">
      <h4><a id="notify-me">Notify Me</a></h4>
      <p>To know about the interviews before anyone else, say hi to <a class="bolded" href="mailto:john@refoundable.com?subject=Hi">john@refoundable.com</a> and tell us what makes you interested in this series.</p>
