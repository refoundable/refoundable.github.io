So he turned to Harvard chemistry professor George Whitesides, PhD, who was working on inexpensive methods for manufacturing microchips. [...] That work led to Science papers in 1994 and 1997 showing [..] that mechanical forces hold as much sway as other external influences over cell behaviors, including growth, differentiation, programmed cell death and migration."

<p>When I was starting in biology, molecular biology and biophysics were explained in mechanical terms: the physics of molecules; the lock and key of an enzyme and a substrate; the helical shape of DNA, etc. It wasn’t only the chemistry that mattered, but the spatial relationships between different molecules as well.</p>

<!--
That changed dramatically when I got to medical and graduate school. Cell biology suddenly became just a question of chemistry. Mechanics were dropped as a subject unfit for study, which was odd considering that cells hadn't changed. They were still made of groups of molecules that interacted spatially, so I knew that mechanics had to be important. 
-->
<p>However, as I got to medical and graduate school, cell biology suddenly became about all chemistry and not much else. Mechanics was completely sidelined, which was odd considering that cells hadn’t changed. They were still made up of large numbers of molecules that were physically interconnected, so mechanics had to be a factor.</p>

<!--
By the time I got to graduate and medical school, cell biology became all chemistry and no mechanics, which was odd since cells are made up of molecules grouped together, so mechanics had to be important.

Then everything changed again when gene cloning arrived. Instead of messing around with individual molecules, now you could simply look for the genetic sequence that controls the expression of that molecule, and flip a switch to turn things on or off. Genetics reinterpreted biology as a series of digital signals.

This appealed to molecular biologists because it made getting experimental results much easier.</p>

<p>Science journals like <em>Cell</em> soon started holding meetings for journalists to explain how biology was being transformed. The world had changed, they said, and genes were now the key to unlock the whole of biology, a perspective remains dominant to this day.</p>

While this reductionism was taking root in biology, I was moving off in a different direction and pursuing my suspicion that mechanics were more important than people realized.

<p>Meanwhile, I was gradually coming around to the idea that mechanics were more important than people realized.</p>

<!--
As an undergrad...that was my first hint.

The second was...
-->

<p>As a young undergraduate, I had seen the first timelapse movies ever made of a developing embryo, and you could see cells divide and get smaller and smaller, then start pulling on each other and sculpting the organs out of the embryo. Although the cells were following genetic instructions, everything about the process was still deeply physical.</p>

I had taken developmental biology courses as an undergraduate. And when you watch a movie of a developing embryo, you see that as cells divide and get smaller and smaller, they start pulling on each other and physically sculpting the different organs out of the embryo.

Another thing I noticed was that cells behaved mechanically in a petri dish. That observation came in the most unusual way. The same week that I was learning how to culture cancer cells for the first time, I was taking an art class on three dimensional design taught by Erwin Hauer. That week, he asked us to build structures that hold their shape using sticks and strings, on condition that the sticks can't touch.
-->

<p>My second big hint had a more colorful story. One day, I noticed some students on campus who were carrying sculptures made of cardboard that looked exactly like some of the viruses I saw in biology textbooks, and I found out that they all came from one sculpture class taught by Erwin Hauer on three dimensional design.</p>

<!--so I signed up for the course.-->

<!--
Art classes at Yale were very tough to get into back then, especially for a science major, but my interview with professor Hauer went well and he invited me to join the class.
-->

<p>Art classes at Yale back then were notorious for being very tough to get into, especially for a science major, but I managed to get an interview with professor Hauer, and explained why I wanted to take the class. I said that three dimensional design was everywhere in biology, from X to Y, and that piqued the professor’s interest enough to invite me to join his class.</p>

<!--
In one class, Professor Hauer gave these instructions. We were to use some wooden sticks and fishing strings he cut to size and build stable structures that hold their shapes. There was just one catch: the sticks must not touch. Then he left.

Professor Hauer came in one day with these instructions. He asked us to use some wooden sticks and fishing strings he cut to size and build stable structures that hold their shapes. There was just one catch: the sticks must not touch. Then he left.
-->

<!--
  One time, Professor Hauer came in with these instructions: we were each to use some wooden sticks and fishing strings we had to build a stable structure that holds its shape, but there was a catch: the sticks must not touch. With that, he left.
-->

<p>In one of those classes, professor Hauer came in and told us to use some wooden sticks and fishing strings we had lying around to build stable structures that hold their shape, but there was a catch: the sticks couldn’t touch. Then, he left.</p>

<!--
We were completely lost until one student figured out how to build one of these structures, and the whole class soon caught on. The key was to use the strings to connect one end of a stick to the opposite end of another so the sticks didn't touch.

<p>For a while, we were completely lost until one student figured out how to build one of these structures, and the whole class soon caught on. The secret was to use the strings to connect the sticks at opposite ends, so the sticks didn’t touch, and as you did that for more pieces, the strings became stretched, creating enough tension to hold the structure together.</p>

  When you culture cells, they're in a dish, they're kind of flattened. You add a chemical that's an enzyme that clips the anchors of the cells to the dish, and the cells were flat, but when you clip the anchors, they just round up, ball up, float, and now you take them and you put them on another dish, where they then reattach and spread.

  When you take cells out of the body, and you put them on a dish, they spread, but if you put them on a flexible substrate, they actually compress into wrinkles, because all cells are in a state of isometric tension or prestress, just like a bow in a bowstring. You can't see it when it's rigid, but they're feeling the forces.

Afterwards, Hauer gave us a slide lecture on "tensegrity," a term first coined by Buckminster Fuller and derived from "tensional integrity," which explains how the structures we built hold their shapes.

That same week, I was learning how to culture cancer cells. When you place cells in a petri dish, they attach themselves flat to its surface, so when you need to move them to another dish, you have to first add a chemical enzyme that detaches the cells from the surface of the dish before you pick them up and move them.

A few days later, in the cancer lab, we added a drug that caused the cells, which were anchored flat to the petri dish, to round up like a ball, so I said "Oh, the tensegrity must have changed!" but back then, people still thought of cells as balloons filled with molasses, so the postdoc who was with me didn't get it, and when I told him that I'd learned about tensegrity in a sculpture class, he told me to never say that word again.

Back then, people still thought of cells as balloons filled with molasses, so the postdoc who was with me didn't get it, and when I told him that I'd learned about tensegrity in a sculpture class, he told me to never say that word again.

Around that time, I was reading the first papers on cell shape, and they talked about a cytoskeleton inside the cell that holds its shape, much in the same way our skeleton does, so it seemed to me at least that the link to tensegrity wasn't completely implausible.

I soon discovered that people in the 1960s talked about structuralism. György Kepes from MIT edited an anthology titled _Structure in Art and Science_, which had chapters written by experts in fields as different as virology, economics, or architecture. They all believed that the answer was not to be found in the individual components, but in the networks, the arrangements, and the functions that emerged from the whole.

I knew from molecular biophysics that when you change biochemistry, you change gene expression. I began to realize that tensegrity offered a way to explain how you convert mechanical forces into changes in cellular biochemistry and gene expression, something we now call Mechanotransduction, a whole subfield of Mechanobiology.

I also discovered that a hundred years prior, in the 1880&#8211;1890s, almost all of biology was called morphomechanics and developmental mechanics. And developmental biologists were able to explain things mechanically that we couldn't explain. That reinforced my belief that mechanical forces are as important as chemicals and genes for the regulation of biology.

My PhD thesis in 1984 tried to prove that by building a tensegrity model of the cell. And most of what I wrote in my thesis is everything I've done since, because I could already see what the principal questions were. I half-jokingly say that was the beginning of the rest of my life.

<!--Yet I pursued the idea. Around that time, the first papers had come ut discussing how cells get their shape, and they described a cytoskeleton, similar to our own skeleton, that holds up the cell.-->

<p>Over at the art library on campus, I discovered that people in the 1960s talked about structuralism. György Kepes at MIT published an anthology titled <em>Structure in Art and in Science</em>, in which architects like Fuller, but also biologists, chemists, artists, and other specialists all stressed that the answer to a complex problem is never found by looking at the individual components—the sticks and strings—but by seeing how they are arranged and connected, that is to say, how the whole comes <span class="txt-wrap">together.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">1</a></sup></span></p>

<p>This idea had profound implications for biology. To take one example, I&nbsp;knew from molecular biophysics that when you change biochemistry, you cause gene expression to change, because the two are connected. Now I began to realize that tensegrity might offer a theory by which to explain how you can cause biochemistry and gene expression to change by changing the mechanical force <span class="txt-wrap">applied.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">2</a></sup></span></p>

<p>Finally, I found the history of biology itself suggestive, as I learned that as late as the 1890s, the discipline was referred to as morphomechanics and developmental mechanics, and biologists of the period were able to explain in mechanical terms problems that were eluding genetic reductionists almost a century later.</p>

<p>By this point, I was convinced that mechanical factors were as important as chemicals and genes in the regulation of biology.

  Why tensegrity matters
  src: 2017-Science_on_Tap-8-Q1-Why_tensegrity_matters

  Q: How did that insight into how cells a structured lead on to a much wider field? 

  So tensegrity allowed me to realize that it's a way that you can convert mechanical forces into changes in rearrangements of structures, whether it's if I push on you, and your body reacts, or down to cellular scale, down to molecular scale, and once you put a force on a molecule, I knew from my molecular biophysics [that] you change biochemistry, you change gene expression.

  You can pull on a motor, and change how it moves. You can pull on an enzyme, and change its activity. You can pull on a molecule in your connective tissue, and unfold it, and it polymerizes in the lines of force? 

  So tensegrity provided a way to explain how you convert mechanical information into changes in cellular biochemistry and gene expression, which we now call mechano-transduction. And that whole field came out of mechanobiology.

  So that's one thing that is core to what I do with this idea that mechanical forces may be as important as chemicals and genes for the regulation of biology.

  Mechanotransduction
  src: 2018-Berkeley-2-5-Q3-How_do_cells_sense_and_respond_to_force-1

  The question was how do cells sense and respond to these forces, what we started to call mechanotransduction.

  When I got in the field, basically people thought of cells like a water balloon filled with molasses. 
  
  I presented an alternative idea which is that cells are built more like tents. If you want to stabilize the tent, you have a flexible membrane, you put 10 poles in, you put 10 pegs in the ground, and then you winch it in to put it under tension or prestress, and you have a stable shape. 

  And this building system comes out of the Buckminster fuller world of geodesic architecture. It's known as tensegrity or tensional integrity.

  I literally built sculpture models with sticks and strings, and showed that you could build models with nuclei, and that they'd be physically connected, and we did various experiments to confirm that this is actually true in living cells.

  I think what was important is that it predicted that the way cells would feel force and respond would be like a pup tent. It feels the force where the pegs hit the ground, not at every point across its membrane. 

  So we predicted that where cells connect their internal skeletal framework to the extracellular support scaffold like extracellular matrix or even other cells, would be a preferred point for force transfer.

  Cells grown on differently shaped islands will behave differently—growing when spread flat on big islands and turning on a suicide program when crowded on tiny islands—even when cultured with the same growth factors under the same conditions.

Specifically, we found that the cell division rate is tied to how much space cells have to stretch and grow. The more room to stretch, the higher the division rate. A useful example is wound healing, where cells on opposite ends keep stretching and dividing until they close the wound. In contrast, when cells are locked in a tight space and they can't stretch, they stop dividing and go into a suicide program called apoptosis and die.

<p>For example, when cells had a lot of room to grow, the stretched and divided continuously until they ran out of space, and the more room they had to expand, the higher the divison rate.

  The next breakthrough was to bring in microfluidics, the means to manipulate miniscule amounts of fluid within an experimental system. Again, Ingber collaborated with Whitesides’ lab. Ingber’s lab started putting cells into the chips. By controlling fluid flow, they realized, you could control a cell’s microenvironment. 
  
  “You could place cells in different positions relative to each other and deliver different chemicals to different points on the surface.”
  
  That opened the door to manipulating cells in microenvironments similar to those in the body.

<p>Later, George started making chips with tiny hollow channels that liquids could flow through, and those looked like artificial blood vessels to me.

<p>For example, with my team at the Wyss Institute, we brought back the magnetic beads I used years earlier and combined them with strong magnets and microfluidic channels to develop an artificial liver that clears the blood passing through it, like a dialysis machine, from pathogens that cause hospital patients to develop a deadly form of blood poisoning known as <span class="txt-wrap">sepsis.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="r8" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">8</a></sup></span></p>

<p>My experience testifies that the more barriers you cross, the more tools, methods, and materials you’ll encounter that are waiting to be combined into your next breakthrough.</p>

<p>I started presenting my research in the mid-1980s, and from the very first moment, I was publicly attacked for it. My tensegrity model of the cell and nucleus was called an art show by senior scientists, “bullshit” was a popular word among my critics, and I&nbsp;was called Darth Vader for promulgating “this force thing.”</p>

<!--
_The Biophysical Journal_ wouldn't publish any of my papers for 30 years because tensegrity was anathema to the editors. One paper received positive peer reviews recommending to accept with minor revisions and it was still turned down. When I appealed to the journal saying we could easily make the minor revisions the reviewers asked for, what I got back from the editors was this reply: "At Biophysical Journal, we only allow one response to reviewers’ comments, and you just used it."

<p>To this day, the term tensegrity is not used. All the other concepts like prestress and cell shape have become an accepted part of biology, but they will not use that word. I was even told explicitly once by a program manager at the NIH that they would be ready to fund my grant requests if I just took that word out.</p>

<p>I never compromised. Early in my career, I had a formative experience working as a postdoc with Judah Folkman and I saw first-hand how he was publicly criticized for his research on tumor angiogenesis in major outlets like <em>Science</em>, <em>Time Magazine</em>, and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.

<p>I learned early on that science is really a sermon on the mount. People don’t get excited until they hear you speak, then they go back and look you up afterwards, which is why going and meeting other scientists is important. No scientist is willing to admit this, but when you make a good impression on another scientist, they’re more likely to trust your work, and when you don’t, they may never trust your work. It’s a people business.</p>

<p>The rise of bioengineering over the course of the last 20–30 years also helped mechanobiology because students began to take engineering courses alongside biology, and mechanics is a big part of engineering.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, science is a very conservative business, and to this day mechanobiology is still a small corner of biology while most scientists are happy doing what they’ve always done for the last fifty years.</p>

<p>Yet, on the flipside, that’s great news for young scientists because it leaves a lot more for them to discover if they don’t go down the conventional path.</p>

<p>I always teach my students that anytime you put forward a new idea, you have to be prepared to do three things:</p>

<p>First, you have to learn how to play by the rules of those who control the current paradigm, and show that you can use their tools and get their results.</p>

<p>Second, you need to develop a new set of tools that enable you to have rigorous control over the important variables they don’t even see.</p>

<p>And third, you must be ready to explain phenomena they can’t explain. My entire career and everthing I’ve done in science is summarized by these three points.</p>

<p>One of the few silver linings of the COVID-19 crisis is the big change of pace that we’re seeing in science. People are posting their results on the web, and within a few days or weeks, others are either confirming the results or showing them to be unrepeatable. The discussion feels dynamic and the science is speeding nicely ahead.</p>

<p>However, that’s not what typically happens in science. A paper usually takes years of delays and revisions to get published, and anything could kill it along the way. An editor might not find it suitable for the journal. Or they might give your interdisciplinary paper to a narrow specialist for review, or worse, to a competing scientist with a conflict of interest. You end up forced to go from journal to journal until you find a good match with one agreeable editor and two reasonable reviewers.</p>

Sadly, that’s more the exception than the rule. A typical paper can take years to be published under normal circumstances. It takes very little to kill it.

You’re forced to go from journal to journal until you find a good match with one editor and two reviewers.

<!--find the right set of one editor and two reviewers // find a match with one editor and two reviewers-->

<p>More and more onerous demands are also placed on scientists looking to publish in high impact journals. When I started out, a typical <em>Science</em> or <em>Nature</em> paper had, say, a couple of images or a single graph each. Now, the supplementary material alone is 15–20 figures, and that’s on top of what’s already in the paper.</p>

Now, the supplementary material alone is 15&#8211;20 figures on top of what's already in the paper.
-->

<p>That’s five papers’ worth of data for a single article. And putting those datasets together might take 2–3 years. Not only does that badly hold up the advance of science, to say nothing of the all time and money it eats up, but the worst part is that it unfairly punishes young scientists as they can never get their papers out in a timely way in order to land a job.</p>

<p>So it’s not surprising that scientists the world over are putting their papers on bioRxiv or medRxiv, where you can easily share your results then immediately turn around and cite your paper in a grant or a follow-up study. As more and more science gets put out there, I suspect that the only question for review journals will eventually be: what’s left?</p>

<!--
For now, there's no doubt that review journals remain an important tool for career advancement. Any scientist who wants to land a job, a grant, or a promotion, if not for them then for their students, has little choice but to compete for a spot in a high impact journal. And that's unlikely to change until we revisit how scientists are hired and fired.

In 2008, TNP-470 was reformulated as an improved oral drug called Lodamin under the supervision of Judah Folkman. It was one of the last projects he led before passing away at the age of 75.  <span class="txt-wrap"><a class="fn-ext-lnk" target="_blank" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2008/07/11/219649/nanotech-revives-a-cancer-drug/">Learn more</a><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon-fn-external-lnk" viewBox="0 0 341 341"><defs></defs><path d="M325 0H69v32h217L0 318l23 23L309 55v201h32V16c0-9-7-16-16-16z"></path></svg></span><a href="#r10" class="fn-btn fn-btn-bot">↩︎</a></p>

  By adding different types of lung cells, Ingber’s team was able to build a living tissue-tissue interface mimicking that of the lung’s smallest air sacs, where capillaries and lung tissue come in contact.

  “What makes an organ an organ isn’t just tissue,” Ingber explains. “It’s having two or more different tissues that come together and form an interface, where new functions emerge.”

<p>Unlike conventional in vitro models which are static, the addition of breathing motions in our lung-chip caused the cells behave like they would in the human body. They started forming directional cilia and made mucus to clear particles away.</p>

<p>We used the model to study microbial infection and lung inflammation, and compared its results with conventional in vitro models and an in vivo mouse model.

We can also control each individual variable. For example, we can add up to four different cell types, and choose what gradients or chemical and mechanical factors to introduce. So we can very quickly parse out which factors are important, and see how different variables interact.

The last big advantage of our organ-on-chip design is that it leverages microchip manufacturing to offer a scalable, robust, and inexpensive solution to meet the needs of advanced drug development, and that's the biggest leap forward.

<p>Another crucial factor we had was the ability to automate things when needed. Early on, each chip was made by hand, and that led to inconsistent results during drug testing. Two different postdocs running identical tests might get different results. That problem went away as we built automated systems, which allowed us to ramp up testing and expand it to multiple labs.</p>

Another crucial factor was having the ability to automate the testing process. In the early days, each chip was made and tested by hand, which was both labor-intensive and highly variable.

Influenza A viruses are classified by subtypes based on the properties of their hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) surface proteins. There are 18 different HA subtypes and 11 different NA subtypes. Subtypes are named by combining the H and N numbers – e.g., A(H1N1), A(H3N2).

<p>Using a lung airway chip, we mimicked the virulence of three common strains of influenza, H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1, and measured the cytokine response. We reproduced human-to-human transmission by infecting a healthy chip with fluid taken from an infected chip. We also showed viral evolution over time and identified known mutations of resistance to drugs found in humans as well as novel mutations never seen before.</p>

<p>In tandem, other members of the team took a computational approach, using highly accurate computer simulations of molecular dynamics to identify existing FDA-approved drugs and novel compounds that bind to the CoV-2 spike protein and which could be tested in lung-chip models.</p>

<!--Cont-->
<p>A second computational effort was kicked off in February with a grant to use machine learning algorithms and sift through data on the gene expression patterns of tens of thousands of known drug compounds, identifying those that have the best potential to revert a disease-state expression pattern back to its normal state. That effort is being led by Jim Collins and his team.</p>

<p>We incorporated these two computational approaches into our testing pipeline, which has screened to date 364 drugs, of which more than 65 drugs are already in clinical trials around the world.</p>

<p>We’re having weekly updates with DARPA, the Gates Foundation, and several public agencies to coordinate our efforts until the immediate crisis is resolved. We’re also part of many discussions looking at long-term strategies to raise our state of readiness against biothreats.</p>

<p>For example, this crisis has shown the need to ramp up the integration of organs-on-chips into BSL-3 labs across the U.S., including CDC and military labs. In a time-sensitive situation such as this one, the sooner we start testing human-relevant models, the faster we can respond.</p>

<!--
In addition, while most academic studies rely on experimental models, organ-chip models have demonstrated their ability to predict human responses and enable us to quickly test drugs under clinically-relevant dose exposures, but we won't make the most of those capabilities until we have cross-validation and a tighter integration between organ-chip studies and clinical studies.
-->

<p>However, to make the most of the capabilities that organ-chip models provide, we also need to see much more cross-validation with clinical studies, not just during this crisis but as a larger goal moving forward. Just as animal models are a key step on the way to a clinical study, we need to get to a point when organ-chip models can inform the decision to run clinical <span class="txt-wrap">studies.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="r21" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">21</a></sup></span></p>

To that end, despite for all the demonstrated ability of organ-chip models to predict human responses and test drugs under clinically-relevant dose exposures, we won't make the most use of those capabilities until we see more cross-validation with clinical studies, which is why we need a much tighter integration between the two.

<!--
In addition, while most academic studies rely on experimental models, organ-models like our lung-chip have shown that they can accurately predict human response, as well as enable us to test drugs quickly and under clinically-relevant dose exposures. The crucial step remaining is to get more cross-validation with clinical studies, which could also call for a tighter integration between organ-models and clinical studies.

<p>The good news is that we’re already starting to see progress in both of those areas, but whether it will be enough or not remains to be seen. If we draw the right lessons from the COVID-19 calamity and improve our systems accordingly, then this terrible pandemic and the tragic loss of life would not have been for nothing.</p>

<!--
The good news is that we’re already starting to see progress in both of those areas, and I think we’ll look back at COVID-19 as the catalyst for a great deal of change that needed to happen sooner rather than later.

<p>New focus areas are never imposed from the top down. Instead, when a core faculty has a visionary idea for an area, we enable them to try it.

<p>Companies readily reinvest their capital in a proven product line over a risky idea in an untested market. In contrast, academia has no trouble generating a wealth of creative and risky ideas, but it lacks the focus to adapt the most promising ones into useful applications.</p>

<p>Academic researchers are not trained to patent the technologies they invent, and their career advancement is not linked to their success at reducing innovations to practice.</p>

<!--
One source of this lack of focus is that researchers are not commonly trained to patent the technologies they invent, and nor is their career advancement tightly linked to their success at reducing innovations to&nbsp;practice.
-->

<p>At the Wyss Institute, we train all of our researchers to write reports of inventions as early in the development phase as possible. The reports go to a intellectual property attorney on site who reviews every report and offers feedback to focus the investigators’ research efforts on the shortest path to new technology that would be worthy of a patent.</p>

<p>Another problem plaguing the academy is that publicly-funded grants often go to support incremental advances in science while the boldest ideas rarely get the support they need. As a result, it’s not uncommon to see researchers working on their most exciting ideas in their spare time between different grant projects.</p>

<p>So when we started the Wyss Institute, we recruited faculty members who had done lots of interdisciplinary work in spite of the system, and we structured the Institute to turbocharge their work by removing any hurdles in the way.</p>

<!--
For example, we don't ask our faculty members to give up their own lab at their home institution when they join the Wyss Institute. We actually prefer that they maintain their own independent culture. However, we encourage them to move their most entrepreneurial postdoctoral fellows, research assistants, and graduate students to our site so they can get the most from working with other faculty groups.

In fact, we want them to maintain their independent culture and move their most entrepreneurial postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and research assistants to our site where they can benefit from working with other faculty groups.</p>

<p>We make collaboration easier by having all of our faculty members and staff in one large open lab, allowing experts from different disciplines, who normally have no reason to work together, to start talking to each other and organically form interdisciplinary teams to work on solving a particular problem.</p>

<!--NO GRANTS - ALL FREE-->

<!--
To that end, all of our staff and faculty members work in a single large open lab instead of having independent labs for each faculty, because experts from different disciplines would have no reason to work with each other if their work environments are completely separate.

we don't provide separate labs to our faculty members, because experts from different disciplines have no reason to work with each other when they keep to their labs. That's why all of our faculty groups and staff share one large open lab, because it easily leads new interdisciplinary teams to form.

Anytime you collaborate with a new institution, a new agreement has to be signed in order to manage the intellectual property arising from the collaboration, which takes a long time.

Another source of misalignment is faculty appointments. The model we went with allows each institution to contribute one faculty member to the Wyss Institute when they join the agreement.

  src: 2014-Don_Ingber-The backstory behind organs-on-chips - Vector

  When he was a doctoral student, Ingber worked to bring the idea of tensegrity (roughly speaking, that compression and tension work within a structure to help it maintain its shape and integrity) into cellular biology. Ingber predicted that tensegrity enables cells to sense mechanical forces through specific surface proteins that link the cell’s external environment (especially the extracellular matrix) to its internal cytoskeleton. (In a 1993 paper in Science, he showed that surface proteins called integrins constitute that link.) paper -> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7684161

  But once in his Boston Children’s laboratory, Ingber realized he had to find a way to sell the concept in an era when molecular growth factors were considered the last word in cell function and tissue development. So he turned to Harvard chemistry professor George Whitesides, PhD, who was working on inexpensive methods for manufacturing microchips. whitesides -> http://gmwgroup.harvard.edu/content.php?page=gwhitesides
  
  That work led to Science papers in 1994 and 1997 showing that cells grown on differently shaped islands will behave differently—growing when spread flat on big islands and turning on a suicide program when crowded on tiny islands—even when cultured with the same growth factors under the same conditions. It proved that mechanical forces hold as much sway as other external influences over cell behaviors, including growth, differentiation, programmed cell death and migration.
  1994 paper -> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8171320 ; 1997 paper -> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9162012

  The next breakthrough was to bring in microfluidics—the means to manipulate miniscule amounts of fluid within an experimental system. Again, Ingber collaborated with Whitesides’ lab. Ingber’s lab started putting cells into the chips. By controlling fluid flow, they realized, you could control a cell’s microenvironment. “You could place cells in different positions relative to each other and deliver different chemicals to different points on the surface,” Ingber says. That capability opened the door to manipulating cells in microenvironments similar to those in the body.

  The last step to true organs on chips was to apply a physiology-centered point of view.

  By adding different types of lung cells, Ingber’s team was able to build a living tissue-tissue interface mimicking that of the lung’s smallest air sacs, where capillaries and lung tissue come in contact.

  “What makes an organ an organ isn’t just tissue,” Ingber explains. “It’s having two or more different tissues that come together and form an interface, where new functions emerge.”

  And to fully capture the lung’s biological and mechanical environment, the team added simulated breathing motions, just like those of a living lung. With that final ingredient, Ingber’s team found they could functionally mimic a human organ—all within a piece of clear rubber polymer the size of a matchbox.

  When the Wyss Institute first opened its doors in 2009, Ingber brought his nascent chip technology with him. In that fertile environment of biologists, engineers, fabrication specialists, machinists, commercialization experts and product developers, the chips took off.

  In 2010, Ingber's team showed that their lung-on-a-chip could simulate the lung’s response to infection and airborne particulates. In 2012, they showed that the chips could mimic a complex human disease state, pulmonary edema, and even demonstrated the ability of a new drug to prevent this life-threatening condition.

  Additional chips quickly followed: a gut chip, a kidney chip, a bone marrow chip and more. Funding from the NIH, FDA, DARPA and pharmaceutical companies has fueled further development and refinement of chips, as well as automated instruments for plugging several chips together, creating human bodies-on-chips for comprehensive drug testing.

  THIS ONE HAS A NICE PICTURE OF THE CHIP - SEE IF YOU CAN GET
  src: 2014-Emulate-Wyss Institute’s technology translation engine launches ‘Organs-on-Chips’ company

  Created with microchip manufacturing methods, an Organ-on-a-Chip is a cell culture device, the size of a computer memory stick, that contains hollow channels lined by living cells and tissues that mimic organ-level physiology. These devices produce levels of tissue and organ functionality not possible with conventional culture systems, while permitting real- time analysis of biochemical, genetic and metabolic activities within individual cells.

  The Wyss Institute team also has developed an instrument to automate the Organs-on-Chips, and to link them together by flowing medium that mimics blood to create a “Human-Body-on-Chips” and better replicate whole body-level responses.
  
  This automated human Organ-on-Chip platform could represent an important step towards more predictive and useful measures of the efficacy and safety of potential new drugs, chemicals and cosmetics, while reducing the need for traditional animal testing. 

  Since their 2010 publication on the human breathing lung-on-a-chip in Science, and with grant support from (DARPA), (FDA) and (NIH), Ingber and his team have developed more than ten different Organs-on-Chip models, including chips that mimic liver, gut, kidney and bone marrow. The DARPA effort also has supported the engineering of the instrument that automates chip operations and fluidically links the different organs-on-chips together to more closely mimic whole body physiology, while permitting high resolution imaging and molecular analysis.
