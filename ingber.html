  Translation

  -> DO THE CONTRARIAN EXERCISE FOR EACH and then develop premises anew

  1) Is it research? Is it translation? Is it both?

  Wyss has an unusual combination of things. It has faculty. And it has an industrial/business team. It owns the research it does, rather than simply trying to translate anything. They're not mercenaries taking someone else's research and innovating with it. The researchers really come to know their technology very closely and then find ways to translate it. This is an important distinction.

  WISV: 
  To translate valuable technologies from the lab to market, which means that you need to assess what technologies might be considered valuable and new, meaning technologies that no one else is working on, i.e. unique, and have the deep expertise to turn them into useful applications.

  FP:
  - the best technologies are unique, no one else has them or is working on them
  - the best technologies that are ready for translation are either ripe enough or can be matured to get the timing right
  - the best people to work on these technologies are the initial researchers who understand it best, who are also, by definition, the only people who understand it
  - effective translation requires that you connect to the market and be able to distinguish between what customers think they want, and what they secretly want.

  WDMPD:
  - Focus on novel research alone
  - Focus on translation alone, like those "startup/venture labs"
  - License technology from universities put it into commercial use

  LIMIT:
  - The research may never find application or get out of the lab
  - You rely on existing technology alone to innovate. This may work in areas where existing technology is improving fast, like computers, and the number of possible combinations of useful technologies is high, and your understanding and control over the problem is deterministic. The strategy does much worse in areas where technology is expensive, the number of useful combinations is limited, and understanding and control are very limited.
  - This worked really well for Lux (in the case of their nuclear waste cleanup company) because they took a contrarian approach to the nuclear problem, and were thus able to acquire technology that was undervalued in a sense. Shifting to the general case then, the limitation you find is IF the technologies you seek to license are not undervalued by their inventors, but may in fact be less important than the most critical research that they may try to keep and commercialize on their own. So the key problem with licensing is that most technologies you might try to license are not likely to be the most valuable technologies out there.

  WIND:
  1) Do your own research in such a way as to make it easier to translate, and 2) identify and develop your own unique research areas that push the frontier of existing technology, and 3) build your own commercial ventures for the most valuable of those technologies, while 4) licensing the rest to partly fund your research.

  Q: what makes the usual academic research hard to translate?
  Q: why was it important for you to develop your own unique research areas to translate? Why not just translate what other academic labs at Harvards were producing? In other words, why is the integrated approach important?
  Q: How do you decide when to license a technology and when to build your own commercial venture? 

  Type -> Majorities, WDMPB? WIP?
  P: Most academic research doesn't translate well because it's too expensive or small scale
  P: Inventing a technology is only 10% of the way. Getting a technology ready for market takes 90% of the effort.
  P: Wyss doesn't translate just about any research, but has its own researh focus areas.

  -> -> -> N.B. July 28, 2020: "To distinguish between what customers think they want, and what they secretly want" is arguably the quintessential formulation of the straussian critique of the lean methodology. The idea that it makes explicit is that there is a key difference between the public preference and the private preference of people. What the lean methodology proposes is to simply surrender to the public preference and take it as the whole truth. By appealing to "science" and focusing on what the greatest number of participants or test subjects in experiments have revealed, the lean methodology is naively oblivious of the distinction that exists between public and private preferences, pre-assuming a liberal view of the world in which people say what they mean and mean what they say, and worst of all, it puts the crowd above the minority of people who may reveal a hidden truth. Perhaps inadvertently, the saving grace that might give people the impression that the lean methodology works has nothing to do with it at all, and it's focusing on small markets. That one piece of advice might be pulling more weight than people assume.

  2) How is the structure different from an academic lab when research is multidisciplinary?

  Wyss is not organized like a typical academic research lab. In fact, its faculty uses research labs AND the Wyss institute together simultaneously. This is again very unusual. And it lets Wyss focus on what it does best, which is to foster collaboration above all else. 

  WISV: Assemble a team that can deliver unique research on the frontier of science and translate that research into a series of applications and commercial ventures

  FP:
  - the best faculty working on novel ideas help to bring uniqueness and the frontier element
  - solving applications requires the collaboration of people from different disciplines

  WDMPD:
  - 1) Keep research siloed in narrow academic fields
  - 2) collaborate on research i.e. the research might be interdisciplinary, but without pursuing a practical application to solve.
  - 3) focus on practical skills for a practical application without bringing in the interdisciplinary research team working at the frontier

  LIMIT:
  - 1) the research never gets translated
  - 2) nominally interdisciplinary, and may lead to some theoretical insights, but won't lead to practical results
  - 3) limited to working with existing technology as opposed to new capabilities made possible by research 

  WIND:
  - releasing the research from siloes by having explicit focus areas that are interdisciplinary and focused on application from the start
  - making it easy for practical industry experts to collaborate with researchers
  - bringing in the practical skills necessary to take the research to market

  Q: How do you get leading experts in different areas to pursue their independent and novel research while at the same working together and with industry experts?
  Q: How much independence do researchers have in their own research? And how much "demand" does the institute make on the researcher? Is the institute, in other words, imposing a top-down agenda, like a tyrant, or is it more like a weak king?
  Q: The Wyss institute doesn't resemble a university/academic structure. It isn't organized like a startup or a corporate hierarchy either. Is it a network? A series of small hierarchies?
  
  You can clearly see that this is a "political" question about "who rules" at the Institute and how people organize themselves OR are organized. Ingber places a lot of emphasis on the "self-assembly" aspect the institute, but how far does this go?

  


  --
  3) The timing question: Most breakthroughs take a long time. Is that somehow cut when you think about translation from the beginning? How do you know when to work on a technology because it will be ready in time versus when you risk being too early?

  -> from FP: the best technologies that are ready for translation are either ripe enough or can be made matured to get the timing right
  -> -> It follows that sometimes, the key is to take a technology that looks way out there and actually mature it. In other words, sometimes research is about taking control of the timing problem and solving it.

  -> The focus areas of the Wyss Institute are relevant here. How does the timing factor into those?

  - Scientists looking to respond quickly to COVID-19 turned to preprints instead of peer review journals, with promising results. What makes peer review publication inadequate to deal with a fast-moving crisis? And is it still, as many believe, the best way to advance science?

  -> -> N.B. July 28, 2020 "is it _always_" is brilliant because it introduces the idea that there may be exceptions to the rule. If you can't say outright that peer review is a dysfunction and corrupt and failed ritual of modern science, you can poke holes in its edifice by evoking all these exceptional cases.

  Synthetic biology promises to revolutionize medicine. And medical advances often find their first application in the military. If so, how far away are we from seeing biotech startups focused on defense?

  "how far" vs "are we too far" -> the latter is more philosophical and speculative, suggests less certainty, which is my intention.

  -> N.B. This here is a breakthrough question for two reasons: July 27, 2020
  1. the change from the plural "generation of biotech startups" to the singular form, one single unique company focused on this
  2. the addition of "anytime soon" which makes the question much more immediate and tangible, especially when combined with the fact that the question is addressed to Ingber as opposed to some general abstract formulation like "Could we see/ Is it possible"

<!--
Step X: Reformulating the questions
_Having already selected and placed the questions in their proper place, I now try to reformulate them into proper questions. I read the questions, then try to list fresh premises based on the question, and then the questions that emerge, and then try to formulate a question based on the premises and the questions. July 12, 2020_

N.B. -> Step XI: Editing the question July 13, 2020 -> After reformulating the first 8 questions yesterday, I went back and reviewed the questions today, and got to make some major changes. I got rid of many "how" and "what" questions, and went straight for the jugular, asking deeper philosophical or contrarian questions instead. It's as if Step X got 70% of the way, and today's review covered the remaining distance. This is a good divison of labor. Unlike yesterday's step, today's review has less "process" to it and more art. I did not look at the list of premises below, but I worked with the text, editing and rewriting and taking the liberty to reformulate the question on the fly. I even ended up splitting a question into two, Q3 -> Q3 and Q4, because it made for a better way to highlight the important issues therein.

1) Type -> Majorities, WDMPB? WIP?
P: Biochemistry and genetics dominated biology at the time
Q: Why did that become the dominant paradigm?
Q: How did biologists miss the mechanical side of biology?

By the early 1970s, the dominant paradigm by which biologists sought to understand life was driven by biochemistry and genetics. How did that happen? And why did biologists miss the mechanical side of biology?

By the early 1970s, the dominant paradigm through which biologists sought to understand life was driven by biochemistry and genetics. Why were the physical and mechanical sides of biology ignored?

2) Type -> Secrets, WISV? WIP?
P: You were trained as a biologist
P: Most academic scientists stay within their discipline
P: To prove tensegrity experimentally, you had to venture outside your field
P: There weren't that many experts within biology that you could turn to
Q: What motivated you to do this?
Q: What challenges did you face?
Q: Who were your supporters?

To prove the connection between mechanical forces and biology, you had to look outside your field and work with chemists and engineers. What motivated you to do that? And who did you collaborate with?

To prove the connection between cell biology and mechanical forces, you had to step outside your field and collaborate with chemists and engineers. What were the hurdles in your way? And how did your early collaborations help you break through?

3) Type -> Majorities, WDMPB? WIP?
P: Most biologists were biased towards the biochemistry and genetics dominated paradigm
P: You made a bold claim that tensegrity and geodesic structures are the architecture of life
P: You also called out the bias and claimed that function often follows form rather than code
Q: How was your theory received?
Q: How has the field of mechanobiology evolved since then?

In your 1998 paper, you made a number of claims based on your research that flew in the face of the dominant paradigm in biology. How was your research received?

4) Type -> Secrets, WISV? WIP?
P: Nanotech has been more hype than real
P: Yet, you're able to work at the nano scale and exert very fine control over the chips and molecules
P: Without this control at the nano scale, organ chips would not be possible
Q: How did you achieve that level of control?
Q: What were the technical breakthroughs that made organ chips possible?

While nanotechnology is mostly still in the realm of science fiction, organ chips would not be possible without a level of very fine control over atoms and molecules.

Organ chips are among the few examples of nanotechnology that works. What were the technical breakthroughs that made it possible?

Organ chips are a rare example of nanotechnology that works. They're also incredibly simple compared to other organ models like organoids. Are other models worse off because they try to do too much? Is the secret to a good model in its simplicity?

It's striking how simple organ chips are. Are other organ models, such as organoids, worse off because they're too complex? Is the secret to a good model in its simplicity?

It's striking how simple organ chips compared to other organ models, such as organoids. In your view, are those worse off because they're too complex? Is the secret to a good model in its simplicity?

5) Type -> Secrets, WISV? WIP?
P: Research made your first prototype possible
P: a 10-organ chip system stands somewhere between research and development
P: The alternative is to try to commercialize, the risk is being too early
Q: How important was the 10-organ system to mature the technology?

Following your first organ chip prototype, you received a grant to build an integrated system of 10 different organ chips. How important was this development work to your later success? Was the technology at the time too immature to commercialize with a single chip?

6) Type -> Secrets, WISV? WIP?
P: A contributing factor in Eroom's law is that good animal models are retired and bad animal models persist
Q: Why have organoids and computer models failed to replace those bad models?
Q: Why did so little effort go into replacing them?
Q: How do organ chips compare as models?

One of the drivers behind Eroom's law is that good animal models are retired while bad animal models persist. Why have organoids and computer models failed to replace those bad models? And what makes organ chips better at modeling how humans respond to drug candidates?

When a drug is discovered, the good animal models used are retired, so bad animal models gradually come to dominate drug R&D. Given this perverse survivorship bias, do you think that organ chips would ultimately complement or replace animal models?

Animal models that lead to a drug discovery are retired, leaving worse models in the pipeline over time. Given this perverse survivorship bias, would organ chips ultimately complement or replace animal models?

When animal models lead to a drug discovery, they're retired, leaving worse models in the drug R&D pipeline over time. Given this perverse survivorship bias, could organ chips one day replace animal models entirely? What are the biggest obstacles to getting there? 

Given the technical and ethical challenges with using animal models, is it enough for organ chips to play a complementary role, or is it ultimately necessary to replace animal models entirely?

X) Type -> Secrets, WISV? WIP?
P: You built your first prototype and published
P: You put forth the idea that organ chips can be connected
P: DARPA build a whole grant program around your idea
Q: Why wasn't a single chip valuable enough to commercialize?
Q: Is the value of organ chips in a single chip or in the system as a whole?

Following your first prototype, you received a grant to build a system connecting 10 different organ chips together. Was the first prototype by itself too early to commercialize? At what point was it evident that the technology was ready to be commercialized?

After building your first organ chip in 2010, you took on the challenge of developing and linking 10 different organ chips together. Why was that the critical next step? At what point did you know that the technology was ready to be commercialized? Is the value in a single chip or in the integration?

7) Type -> Secrets, WISV? WIP?
P: The FDA is often seen as being at odds with biotech startups
P: Drug companies can be set in their ways
P: Yet, you've been able to work with both from fairly on
Q: What's motivating the close collaboration?
Q: And do you think organ chips will simply complement or eventually replace animal models?

The FDA and the big drug companies are often taken to be at odds with innovative biotech startups. However, you've been working closely with both on validating organ chips. Is there a secret to such a successful collaboration? And how far do you think this will take organ chips? 

Since the early beginnings, you've worked closely with the FDA and big drug companies on validating organ chip technology. What's motivating this unusual collaboration? And do you see organ chips complementing animal models or ultimately replacing them?

Major drug companies and the FDA and have been closely involved in validating your organ chip technology. How has Eroom's law influenced this collaboration? And how do you see the role of organ chips evolving over time in drug R&D?

You've been working closely with major drug companies and the FDA to validate your organ chip technology. What's been motivating this collaboration? And what do you say to those who hold that innovating in a highly regulated industry like Pharma is too hard?

8) Type -> Secrets, WISV? WIP?
P: large-scale clinical trials are the biggest cost in drug R&D
P: Mass production of organ chips is still relatively challenging
Q: What are the challenging in scaling chip production and use?
Q: If organ chips are widely used, could that reverse Eroom's law?

Large-scale clinical trials are by far the biggest cost in drug R&D. What are the challenges in scaling the production and use of organ chips? And should organ chips achieve wide adoption, could that reverse Eroom's law?

Large-scale clinical trials are the single biggest cost of drug R&D. Do you see a way of using organ chips to reduce our reliance on such trials? Or is trying to reverse Eroom's law a bridge too far?

9) Type -> Majorities, WDMPB? WIP?
P: Most universities have technology licensing offices
P: The theory is that the model of benchtop to industry works
P: In practice, academics work in a way that doesn't prepare their research to be commercialized
P: Ingber believes academics need to change how they run research in order to prepare technology for industry
Q: Where are the bottlenecks in getting research out of the lab?
Q: How far does a university lab take a technology? And how much further does it need to go before it can be commercialized?
Q: Does the typical division of labor severely underestimate the difficulty of commercializing a technology?

N.B. There's a big gap in the middle, the so-called valley of death, that's just simply ignored by the classic model which presents a very tidy view of the divison of labor between universities and industry. The reality is that the research university only gets a very small percentage of the way to the final technology that makes it into the market. But this truth is indeed severely understated.

Many will argue that the division of labor between university research labs and industry is adequate. What's wrong with that view? Is there a hidden bottleneck in getting academic research out of the lab?

Most research universities have technology transfer offices. Most will argue that the division of labor between university research labs and industry is valid. Where do you see the bottleneck in getting research out of the lab?

Where do you see the bottleneck in getting promising research out of the lab and into the world? If most research universities have a technology transfer office, what makes a translation institute necessary? What makes it different? 

Where are the big bottlenecks?

Academic scientists don't run research like product engineers. What are the big bottlenecks in releasing academic research from the lab? Is the imagined division of labor between the academy and industry too idealized? Does it understate the difficulty of turning scientific discoveries into commercial ventures?

10) Type -> Secrets, WISV? WIP?
P: Translation doesn't mean no research
P: Translation is different from a startup or even a corporate research lab.
P: Translation takes a surprisingly large number of people and a lot of collaboration, often between many different organizations, to pull off.
Q: How do you build a culture that enables academic scientists to push the frontier and still work with industry experts on practical problems?
Q: Having seen academia and startups, how is the Wyss Institute different from both? And how is it similar?

N.B. They call it "translation" but what they really ought to call it is "coordination" because that is perhaps the biggest and most important hidden aspect of the whole thing, an enormous amount of coordination between a relatively small number of people on the inside, and a significant number of people outside. -- Academic science is too insular. Startups are too impatient. A translation institute is more open, and has longer time horizons. July 13, 2020

  Q: What other areas might account for why there's been a slow uptake in some areas of life sciences for using organ-chip tech as opposed to animal models

  P: The slowest area is academics. Most labs will always do what they've always done. The benchmark is a mouse model. And they've developed engineering mouse models. And you have to prove that you can replicate it in their mouse model. But the fact is that there are many cases e.g. alzheimer's disease, where all the predictions from the mouse model from all those years have failed every single time in clinical trials.

  I think this is how academia works. I watch this every time we try to publish a paper. In science, people tend to focus on the areas in which they're experts when they review a paper or grant. And they say "well, you haven't done this single/specific part of it any differently than we did that particular part before" and another reviewer will say that their part of it is not that different, etc. and the point is that these models allow you to do all these different assessments that others do, but in a human-relevant model, while mimicking human clinical results, as opposed to mouse results. 
  
  Science is a very conservative business. One of the most amazing things about the COVID-19 crisis is that people are just putting their results on the web, and then in a matter of days, people are either repeating it or showing it not right. There is a dynamic discussion, science is moving much faster, whereas in my own work, it would take years to get a paper published, because the reviewers will come up with these criticisms (and this happens to all people). You go from journal to journal to journal, and in the end, you get published in a good journal, but you have to get the right set of two reviewers and an editor. It's a broken business in my view in terms of getting science out there. Even public access journals take a while to go through the review process. And the review process is two scientists, who may be competitors, or have a very narrow viewpoint. And with the COVID-19 crisis, you get it out there, and if two or more groups confirm it, it's real, and if they don't, you very quickly find out if it was real or not (LIMIT: some will counter that there's a problem regarding the rewards of replicating science versus coming up with original findings. Brian Nosek discusses this in great detail.) To me this has been one of the most interesting experiences, to see how broken scientific communication, publication, review system is, and how it holds back the advance of science.

  -> -> "getting science out there" is arguably the first part of "translation" If Wyss focuses on getting science out of the lab, there's an initial question which is how to get sciece results published in the first place, so that might arguably be my angle.

  Q: Mercedes's F1 Team recently managed to develop an airway device that was approved within a few weeks (as opposed to millions of pounds and lots of review stages and long delays)

  P: It has been absolutely amazing that people have published on the web (on bioarchiv and medarchiv that go up within two days) methods on how to make 3D printed parts or equipments, and other people around the world are making iterations on that. Now if you had to publish a paper on that before COVID-19, it would take a year if you were lucky, and reviewers would say it's not novel because people know how to make masks and what not. I have been trying to publish papers on Influenza models in 4 journals and still haven't managed to do that. I put it up on bioarchiv a year ago because i thought it was important, but all the reviewers don't see the importance. But the whole idea is having models that respond in a pandemic. But that's not of interest to a reviewer who works on a very narrow aspect of how viral replication works for example.

  Q: You've raised the point about academics and publishers. What advice would you give publishers to help accelerate that pace and prevent that conservative bias?

  P: People all over the world are putting up papers on bioarchiv and medarchiv. I'm doing that on every paper. So it's out there already. But why not that leverage what's out there, see how people respond as part of the review process, and maybe have the review not focus on every little point in the paper, but on the major issues where the concerns are, saving a lot of time by focusing on the key points, and not requiring more and more experiments. Most young people don't have the funding to do the level of studies, or maybe the paper should get out there so other people could build on it, and someone else could do that additional set of studies. When I was a grad student and a post-doc, papers in journals like science and nature had fewer figures with one graph or two pictures each (e.g. A,B,C,D) Now, all of us have to have supplementary materials with 15-20 figures on top of the 4-5 in the papers, all of which go through A-K. It takes a lot of time, a lot of money, it's unfair to young people, and people wait to have the complete story which takes 2-3 years and that holds up the advance in science.

  Q: What about the concern that making things ironclad requires a very stringest review process?

  P: It needs to be clear that these papers are preliminary results, but no matter where you publish, whether in your journal or any journal in the world that has the best reviewers, it's only when others repeat that and get the same results and then build on that the field moves forward. The best journals have papers that turned out to be wrong that other people couldn't repeat. So it really comes down to this: Do other scientists find it useful, and validate it with a follow up paper? If you could do that equally quickly, cos you're posting it on the web as soon as you get your results, then that validates it more than having two individuals (the reviewers) who might have conflicts of interest or might hold back publishing becos they want to see the complete story before it goes out.

  I understand the concerns, but this is happening already. So really now the question is how do you develop a publication system that accepts the reality that this is going out really fast and people are reading these papers and citing them, and how do we promote something that would be a validation or review or critique system of that as quickly as possible. 
  
  I'm not saying that putting all this data out on its own is sufficient. I'd still go and get it peer reviewed as well. I'm saying that the peer review process is often more destructive, especially to young people, than it is constructive.

  The idea of some entity having a follow-up about a publication, even if it peer-reviewed, like a validation index that says "this has been confirmed by 2-3-4-6 groups around the world" "this has been disproved" I think that sort of thing would be hugely valuable. But to hold back publications for years because of nitpicky things, and we know they're nitpicky because the same paper comes out in a higher impact journal three years later, because it got better reviewers and editors. Before COVID-19, you could say this is how we do things, but in my view, in COVID-19 you really see just how detrimental that is to our ability to fight disease and really advance human health in the best way we really could.

  P: In other words, if others confirm it, it's real, and it they don't, you very quickly find out
  P: no matter where you publish, it's only when others repeat that and get the same results and then build on that the field moves forward. So it really comes down to this: Do other scientists find it useful, and validate it with a follow up paper?
  P: If you could do that equally quickly, cos you're posting it on the web as soon as you get your results, then that validates it more than having two individuals (the reviewers) who might have conflicts of interest or might hold back publishing becos they want to see the complete story before it goes out.

  Rephrase
  P: Most people in science consider peer review to be the gold standard or sacred cow of science journals
  P: What is actually valuable is whether other scientists find the results useful and validate it
  P: Speed of publishing of original and follow-up papers end up being the most important aspect of that
  P: Peer review typically only gets in the way of that speed
  P: COVID-19 revealed all this by putting a stress test on the system

  P: Science journals place a lot of importance on peer review. 
  P: Peer review is held as the golden standard by science journals.
  P: but during COVID-19, open access preprints replaced journals, and the speed of publishing and validating results through replication turned out to be the most important thing
  Q: Are peer review journals holding back the advance of science by slowing down the rate of publishing?

  WISV:
  Rapid response to a disease by publishing and validating quickly, in other words, by getting science to work as an open, collaborative enterprise as it was intended
  
  FP:
  - open publishing and access to papers
  - sharing results as quickly as one can get them out
  - relying on replication instead of expertise to determine what's true and what's not
  - good results rise to the top, bad results are pushed to the bottom

  WDMPD:
  - normally, they rely on peer review in "respectable" science journals
  - they put up with the incredibly stringent and arduous demands of peer review
  - they don't speak up against the problems with peer review
  - they adapt to the system and accept the delays

  LIMIT:
  - entrenches the power of these science journals and this process
  - only makes peer review over time and more expensive and time consuming, which makes it unfair to younger scientists
  - conformity is reinforced and the system goes unchallenged
  - nothing changes over time, and there's a sense of learned helplessness

  WIND:
  - Switching to pre-prints first, and taking pre-prints seriously, ignoring peer review journals almost completely, and relying on validation results from other groups

  Basically, we went from total conformity to peer review journal publication one day to the complete opposite in the span of a few weeks.

  Q: Do you see any of this change continuing past the pandemic?
  Q: What does this change reveal about the problems with the old regime? When the stakes became really high, we saw an outbreak of sanity and people focused on what truly matters, which is getting results out and relying on validation
  Q: Do you think that the experience and results of COVID-19 may embolden more scientists to speak up?
  Q: Why have scientists put up with the old regime for so long? (the political question; courage vs. genius, conformity...)

  Almost overnight, COVID-19 triggered a massive change in science, as open access preprints became more important than peer review journals. Do you see any of this change continuing past the pandemic? What does this change reveal about the problems with the old regime?

  - COVID-19 transformed open access preprints overnight into a more valuable resource than peer review journals. Is this good news for the advance of science? And do you think it could be a lasting change?

  Overnight, COVID-19 transformed open access preprints into a more valuable resource than peer review journals. Is this good news for the advance of science? Is peer review holding back our ability to make rapid progress?

  Overnight, COVID-19 transformed open access preprints from a secondary repository into a resource more valuable than peer review journals. Is this good news for the advance of science?

  - Overnight, COVID-19 turned open access preprints from a secondary repository into a resource more valuable than peer review journals. Is this good news for the advance of science?

  Why was the change so sudden?
  Do you think we'll return to business as usual once this crisis subsides?

  - Overnight, COVID-19 turned open access preprints from a secondary repository into a resource more valuable than peer review journals. Is this good or bad news for the advance of science? And do you hope to see any lasting changes to peer review publication as a result of this crisis?

  - Overnight, COVID-19 turned open access preprints from a secondary repository into a resource more valuable than peer review journals. Is this good or bad news for the advance of science? And what can peer review journals learn from this crisis?

  - Overnight, COVID-19 turned open access preprints from a secondary repository into a resource more valuable than peer review journals. Is this good or bad news for the advance of science? Has peer review publication become too slow and cumbersome?

  Is peer review publication too slow to respond to a fast-moving crisis?

  Overnight, COVID-19 turned open access preprints from a secondary repository into a resource more valuable than peer review journals. Is this an indictment of peer review publication as too slow to respond to a fast-moving crisis?

  Scientists looking to respond quickly to COVID-19 turned to open access preprints instead of peer review journals. Is peer review publication too slow to respond to a fast-moving crisis?

  - Scientists looking to respond quickly to COVID-19 turned to preprints instead of peer review journals, with promising results. What makes peer review publication inadequate to deal with a fast-moving crisis? And given this change, is peer review still the best way to advance science?
