Instead of messing around with individual molecules, you could now look for the genetic sequence that controled the expression of this or that molecule and switch it on or off. This appealed to molecular biologists because it made getting experimental results much easier.</p> <p>Science journals like <em>Cell</em> even held meetings for journalists to explain the big change about to overrun biology. The world was changing, they said, and genes were holding the key to unlock the whole of biology, a perspective that still dominates to this day.</p> <p>During this time, I was going off in a different direction, having become convinced during my stay at Yale that cell mechanics were as important as chemical and genes to the regulation of biology. This happened through a series of serendipitous insights.</p> <p>The first was in a class on developmental biology. I got to watch the earliest timelapse movies of a developing embryo that were just coming out. I could see the cells divide and get smaller and smaller, then start to pull on each other and sculpt the various organs out of the embryo. Where others saw nothing more than cells executing genetic code, I saw something about the process that was irreducibly physical.</p> <figure> <video class="inl-vid" id="vid-1" height="100%" autoplay="" muted="" src="/assets/video/buf.mp4" data-echo="/assets/video/res-int-ingber-1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <figcaption id="vid-cap-res-int-ingber-1">A timelapse of a zebrafish embryo undergoing cell division and early organ formation.&nbsp;<span class="credits credits-inl">Phoebe Grigg</span></figcaption> <div class="replay-btn-wrapper"> <button type="button" class="replay-btn-text" id="replay-btn-1" onclick="replayVideo(&quot;vid-1&quot;)">Replay<svg class="replay-btn-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 50 59"><defs></defs><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M25.13 15H25a19 19 0 1019 19h6A25 25 0 1125.27 9L20.9 3.96 25.4.02l10.5 12.08-.44.38-10.31 11.45-4.46-4.01L25.13 15z"></path></svg></button> </div> </figure> <p>My second insight was more colorful. One day, I noticed some students on campus who were carrying sculptures made of cardboard that looked like viruses I saw in biology books, and I found out that they all came from one sculpture class on three dimensional design taught by Erwin Hauer.</p> <p>Art classes at Yale back then were notoriously difficult to get into, especially for a science major, but I managed to get an interview with professor Hauer and I explained why I was looking to take the class. “Three dimensional design was everywhere in biology” I argued, giving him one example after another until he finally invited me to join his class.</p> <p>My persistence paid off when professor Hauer came to class one day and asked every student to build a stable structure that can hold its shape using nothing but some wooden struts and fishing strings we had on hand. Before he left, he added one more condition: the struts couldn’t touch.</p> <p>We were completely lost for a while until one student figured out how to build one of these structures, and we all soon caught up. The trick was to connect the struts using the strings in such a way as to create enough tension in the fishing strings to hold the structure together.</p> <figure> <video class="ful-vid" id="vid-2" height="100%" autoplay="" muted="" src="/assets/video/buf.mp4" data-echo="/assets/video/res-int-ingber-2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <figcaption id="vid-cap-res-int-ingber-2">Ingber and his classmates built structures similar in principle to the ones seen here, in which wooden struts push out against a network of elastic threads, putting each structure in a state of isometric tension or&nbsp;prestress that stabilizes its shape.&nbsp;<span class="credits credits-inl">Joseph Arnold</span></figcaption> <div class="replay-btn-wrapper"> <button type="button" class="replay-btn-text" id="replay-btn-2" onclick="replayVideo(&quot;vid-2&quot;)">Replay<svg class="replay-btn-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 50 59"><defs></defs><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M25.13 15H25a19 19 0 1019 19h6A25 25 0 1125.27 9L20.9 3.96 25.4.02l10.5 12.08-.44.38-10.31 11.45-4.46-4.01L25.13 15z"></path></svg></button> </div> </figure> <p>When professor Hauer returned to class, he gave us a slide lecture to explain the governing principle behind the structures we built, and that was when I first learned about “tensegrity,” a stand-in term for “tensional integrity” coined by Buckminster Fuller, who made the most famous use of the principle building geodesic <span class="txt-wrap">domes.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">1</a></sup></span></p> <p>During the lecture, the professor carried a sphere built on the same principle, only it used elastic strings, and when he pressed down on it with his hand, it collapsed, but when he let go, it bounced right back into shape.</p> <p>Not knowing what to make of this yet, a few days later, I headed to the other side of campus where I was about to learn how to culture cancer cells for the first time.</p> <p>When you place cells in a petri dish, they stretch out against the flat surface and anchor themselves in place. So when you need to move them, you add a chemical enzyme that releases their anchors before you try to pick them up.</p> <p>To my surprise, when I added the enzyme, the cells that laid flat against the surface of the dish instantly bounced up like elastic balls, so I said the first thing that came to my mind: “Oh, the tensegrity must have changed!”</p> <figure> <video class="inl-vid" id="vid-3" height="100%" autoplay="" muted="" src="/assets/video/buf.mp4" data-echo="/assets/video/res-int-ingber-3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <figcaption id="vid-cap-res-int-ingber-3">Cells anchor themselves flat against the surface of a petri dish, but when their anchors are released, they quickly round up, suggesting that they're in a state of isometric tension.&nbsp;<span class="credits credits-inl">Don Ingber</span></figcaption> <div class="replay-btn-wrapper"> <button type="button" class="replay-btn-text" id="replay-btn-3" onclick="replayVideo(&quot;vid-3&quot;)">Replay<svg class="replay-btn-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 50 59"><defs></defs><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M25.13 15H25a19 19 0 1019 19h6A25 25 0 1125.27 9L20.9 3.96 25.4.02l10.5 12.08-.44.38-10.31 11.45-4.46-4.01L25.13 15z"></path></svg></button> </div> </figure> <p>Back then, people still thought of cells as balloons filled with molasses, so my comment fell flat on the surpervising postdoc, and when I explained that I learned about tensegrity in a sculpture class, he told me to never say that word again.</p> <p>I was very intrigued by what I saw, so I went looking for answers. Around this time, the first papers to discuss the shape of cells were published, and they were describing a structure supporting the cell called the cytoskeleton.</p> <p>Over at the art library on campus, I found that people in the 1960s were seriously discussing structuralism. In an anthology titled <em>Structure in Art and in Science</em> and edited by György Kepes at MIT, architects like Fuller, but also biologists, chemists, artists, and other specialists argued that uncovering the secrets of complex systems is not done by looking at the individual components but by understanding how they’re arranged and <span class="txt-wrap">connected.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">2</a></sup></span></p> <p>This idea had immediate relevance to me. I knew from molecular biophysics that when you make a change to the biochemistry of a cell, its gene expression also changes, as the two are connected. I began to wonder whether making changes to the mechanical force applied on the cell might, in a similar way, cause its biochemistry and gene expression to change as well. If that was the case, then tensegrity might offer the theory by which to explain the <span class="txt-wrap">connection.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">3</a></sup></span></p> <p>That’s what I tried to show in my PhD thesis in 1984 and with the tensegrity model I built of the cell and nucleus revealing the mechanical connection that allows them to coordinate their <span class="txt-wrap">actions.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="r4" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">4</a></sup></span></p> <p>In fact, most of what I wrote in my thesis is everything I’ve done since, because even then all the major questions were clear, and with the benefit of hindsight, that was the beginning of the rest of my life.</p> <figure> <img class="ful-img" alt="The tensegrity model of the cell and nucleus built by Don Ingber is exhibited at the Martin-Gropius-Bau Museum in Berlin in 2016." id="img-res-int-ingber-1" src="/assets/img/buf.png" data-echo="/assets/img/res-int-ingber-1.jpg"> <figcaption id="img-cap-res-int-ingber-1">In 1984, Ingber built this tensegrity model of the cell and nucleus.

Existing methods, like electrophoresis, were inadequate for this purpose, so I had to come up with new ways to control the geometry of the cell.</p> <p>The first was to use magnetic beads to pull on the cell receptors, and I got engineers to help me find the right nanometer-sized beads that matched the scale of the receptors. That experiment showed that pulling on certain receptors called integrins activated signaling pathways on the surface of the cell and even turned on gene transcription in the <span class="txt-wrap">cell.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="r5" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">5</a></sup></span></p> <p>A second method allowed us to control the shape of the entire cell using mechanical force alone, which led to the surprise discovery that changing the shape of a cell changed its function and even its <span class="txt-wrap">fate.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="r6" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">6</a></sup></span></p> <p>For example, when cells had a lot of room to grow, they divided nonstop until they ran out of room, and the more space they had to expand, the higher their divison rate. By contrast, when cells had no room to grow at all, they activated a suicide program called apostasis and died.</p> <p>Between these two extremes, cells that grew normally neither divided endlessly nor committed suicide. Instead, they began to differentiate, so liver cells made liver proteins, capillary cells formed tubes, and so on. And by harnessing cells in that in-between region, we could engineer small capillary blood vessels in a few hours, which is now one of many applications of tissue engineering.</p> <p>The tools used in this method came out of the chemistry lab of George Whitesides. He had developed an inexpensive way to make thousands of computer microchips, and when I learned about it, I realized that microchip manufacturing offered control over features at the same scale as cells and tissues. So George and I began to collaborate and we published a series of papers <span class="txt-wrap">together.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="r7" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">7</a></sup></span></p> <p>Later, George started making chips with tiny hollow channels that liquids could flow through, which looked like artificial blood vessels to me, and they had the crucial feature that two liquids flowing through the same channel wouldn’t mix thanks to laminar flow.

One paper received positive peer reviews recommending to accept it with minor revisions and it was still turned down. When I appealed to the journal saying we could easily make the minor revisions, the sole answer I got from the editors was: “At the Biophysical Journal, we allow one response only to reviewer comments, and you just used it.”</p> <p>To this day, the term tensegrity is not used. All the other concepts like prestress and cell shape have become an accepted part of biology, but they will not use that word. I was once even told explicitly by a program manager at the NIH that they would be ready to fund my grant requests if only I would take that word out.</p> <p>I never compromised. Early in my career, I had a formative experience working as a postdoc with Judah Folkman and I saw first-hand how he was publicly criticized for his research on tumor angiogenesis in major outlets like <em>Science</em>, <em>Time Magazine</em>, and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.

People don’t get excited until they hear you speak, then they go back and look you up afterwards, which is why meeting other scientists is so important. Few scientists will admit this, but when you make a good impression on another scientist, they’re more likely to trust your work, and when you don’t, they may never trust your work. It’s a people business.</p> <p>The rise of bioengineering over the course of the last 20–30 years also helped mechanobiology because students began to take engineering courses alongside biology, and mechanics is a big part of engineering, so that made for an easier transition.</p> <p>Nevertheless, science is a very conservative business, and to this day mechanobiology is still a small corner of biology while most scientists are happy doing what they’ve always done for the last fifty years.</p> <p>On the flipside, I suppose that young scientists should take that as great news because it leaves a lot more for them to discover, so long as they avoid going down the same old tired path.</p> <p>I try to teach my students that anytime you put forward a major new idea, you have to be prepared to defend it in three ways:</p> <p>First, you have to learn how to play by the rules of those who control the present paradigm, and show that you can use their tools and get their results. Second, you need to develop a new set of tools that enable you to have rigorous control over the important variables others don’t even see. And third, you must be ready to explain phenomena others can’t explain.</p> <p>My entire career and everything I’ve done in science is contained in these three points.</p> <p class="qst" id="q5">You've been critical of peer review publication. what's the situation?<a class="qst-lnk" href="#q5"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a></p> <p>One of the few silver linings of the COVID-19 crisis is the big change of pace that we’re seeing in science. People are posting their results on the web, and within a few days or weeks, others are either confirming the results or showing them to be unrepeatable. The discussion feels dynamic and the science is speeding ahead.</p> <p>However, that’s not what typically happens in science. A single paper usually takes years of delays and revisions to be published. Anything could kill it along the way. An editor might not find it suitable for the journal. Or they might give your interdisciplinary paper to a narrow specialist for review, or worse, to a competing scientist with a conflict of interest. You end up forced to go from journal to journal until you find the right set of one willing editor and two reasonable reviewers.</p> <p>More and more onerous demands are also placed on scientists looking to publish in high impact journals. When I started out, a typical <em>Science</em> or <em>Nature</em> paper had, say, a handful of images or a single graph each. Now, the supplementary material alone is 15–20 figures, and that’s on top of what’s already in the paper.</p> <p>That’s five papers’ worth of data for a single article. And putting those datasets together might take 2–3 years. Not only does that badly hold up the advance of science, to say nothing of the all time and money it eats up, but the worst part is that it unfairly punishes young scientists as they can never get their papers out in a timely way in order to land a good job.</p> <p>So it’s not surprising that scientists the world over are putting their papers on bioRxiv or medRxiv, where you can easily share your results then immediately turn around and cite your paper in a grant or a follow-up study. As more and more science gets put out there, I suspect that the only question for review journals eventually will be: what’s left?</p> <p>For now, there’s no doubt that review journals remain an important tool for career advancement. Any scientist who wants to land a job, a grant, or a promotion, if not for them then for their students, has little choice but to compete for a spot in a high impact journal. That won’t change until we revisit how scientists are hired and fired.</p> <div class="footnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn1"> <p>Tensegrity is an architecture that enables a structure to maintain its stability by balancing the counteracting forces of compression and tension.

We called this approach “biologically inspired engineering” in contrast to bioengineering which uses engineering principles to do XYZ.</p> <p>At launch, we had 14 founding faculty members with a broad range of expertise and interests across biology, clinical medicine, most engineering fields, chemistry, computer science, robotics, and more. We decided to organize our research efforts around a few major focus areas at the intersection of many disciplines, such as living cellular devices, synthetic biology, molecular robotics, and others.</p> <p>Each focus area was led by a core faculty, and brought together faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and technical staff to develop new tools, methods, and materials that can drive the next wave of innovations.</p> <figure> <img class="ful-img" alt="Tiny flying robots with insect wings" id="img-res-int-ingber-5" src="/assets/img/buf.png" data-echo="/assets/img/res-int-ingber-5.jpg"> <figcaption id="img-cap-res-int-ingber-5">Inspired by the biology of a fly, these robotic insects achieve vertical takeoff, hovering, and steering thanks to two wafer-thin wings that flap at 120 times per second.

Instead, when a core faculty has a visionary idea for a new area, we give them the means to try it. Sometimes that means asking the heads of other areas to take a small budget cut, but we’ve never had an issue because the faculty understand better than anyone that new focus areas benefit the Institute as a&nbsp;whole.</p> <p>For example, when David Walt joined as a core faculty, he had a vision for a “diagnostics accelerator” that would identify the unmet needs of clinicians, find new technologies that meet those needs, and accelerate their translation into the <span class="txt-wrap">clinic.<sup><a href="#fn25" id="r25" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">25</a></sup></span></p> <p>We turned that vision into a Wyss Institute initiative led by Walt with the collaboration of his lab at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, and that initative is allowing us to validate our technologies with hard clinical data, and work closer to clinicians than ever before.</p> <p class="qst" id="q13">The Wyss Institute tries to combine the novelty of academic research with the practicality of industry. Why is the integration important?<a class="qst-lnk" href="#q13"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a></p> <p>Mature companies face a classic innovator’s dilemma. When they have to choose between betting the company on a risky idea or doubling down on their success, most will choose the latter.</p> <p>Meanwhile, academia can generate a wealth of creative ideas, but it doesn’t have the focus to see the most promising ones turned into useful applications. Academic researchers are not trained to patent the technologies they invent, and their career advancement is not linked to their success at reducing innovation to practice.</p> <p>At the Wyss Institute, we expect all our researchers to write reports of inventions as early in the development phase as possible. The reports go to an intellectual property attorney on site who reviews every one and offers feedback to focus the investigators’ research efforts on the path most likely to lead to valuable new patents.</p> <p>Another problem plaguing the academy is that publicly-funded grants often go to support incremental advances in science while the boldest ideas rarely get the support they need. As a result, it’s not uncommon to see researchers working on their most exciting ideas in their spare time between different grant projects.</p> <p>So when we started the Wyss Institute, we recruited faculty members who had done lots of interdisciplinary work in spite of the system, and we structured the Institute to turbocharge their work by removing any hurdles in the way.</p> <p>For example, we don’t ask our faculty to give up their lab at their home institution when they join us. In fact, we want them to keep their independent culture and simply move their most entrepreneurial postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and research assistants to the Institute where they can work on problems that can only be solved through an interdisciplinary effort.</p> <p>We make collaboration easier by having all of our faculty members and staff in one large open lab, allowing experts from different disciplines, who normally have no reason to work together, to start talking to each other and organically form new interdisciplinary teams.</p> <p>We also provide a sophisticated machine shop staffed by experienced full-time engineers, something you won’t find in most medical schools or academic labs. It houses a versatile set of manufacturing tools that enable us to prototype and build almost any type of device, from a soft robot down to a living microchip, and choose from a wide range of materials, many of which are approved by the FDA for use in medical applications.</p> <p>In addition, we recruited 40 technical staff scientists and engineers to join the Wyss Institute from industry. Each brings years to decades of product development experience from companies like AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKlein, Pfizer, Biogen, iRobot, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and Procter &amp; Gamble among others.</p> <p>Technical staff are not a new addition to research centers, but while they’re usually assigned to run the research facilities, we prefer to bring them into our development teams.</p> <p>The result is, for example, that when one of our scientists goes looking for a material that has particular physical properties, the answer might come from one of our technical staff who encountered a material with similar properties under a very different setting.</p> <p>When you combine that with the experience of our technical staff in setting timelines and meeting milestones, you get a dramatic boost to our development teams’ ability to reduce innovation to practice, and do so at a pace rarely seen in academia.</p> <p class="qst" id="q14">Being too early to market is always a risk when working with cutting-edge research.

Likewise, when we brought in entrepreneurs-in-residence, they were also quick to talk to venture capitalists.</p> <p>After seeing a number of these early discussions, we realized that we could triangulate what investors and companies needed to close the deal, so we launched a program called “Institute Projects.”</p> <p>We asked every development team to turn the feedback they got from investors and industry into a plan that outlined how the technology should be developed further to warrant venture capital funding and increase the likelihood of commercial success.</p> <p>Qualified teams could request funds from the Institute to recruit entrepreneurs-in-residence with expertise in the field, and to carry out late-stage validation efforts, like reducing manufacturing costs, demonstrating buy-in from clinicians, conducting a regulatory and market analysis, and running phase I clinical trials.</p> <p>The program was a great success, but we soon realized that there was a void between the early research and Institute Projects, so to bridge that gap, we started a second program called “Validation Projects.”</p> <p>There, the goal was to identify promising technologies in our pipeline that have been refined enough to be ready for development based on a set of technical, legal, and commercial criteria. Teams that qualified then worked on de-risking the technology and validating its applicability and market potential.</p> <p>With that, we had a complete technology translation funnel that moved from complete creative freedom in the early research phase to a well-defined roadmap by the time you got to the commercialization phase.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the funnel is not a rigid formula and the details will vary from case to case. For example, with organs-on-chips, it was DARPA’s non-dilutive $37M grant that carried the technology across the entire funnel, and that was a clear sign of an idea whose time had come.</p> <p class="qst" id="q15">The Wyss Institute coordinates with a dozen different partners, from academic institutions to hospitals, to take innovations out of the lab.

Four months before we opened our doors in January 2009, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Eight billion dollars of Harvard’s endowment vanished. Hospitals were extremely worried. And amid this chaos, we had the biggest gift in Harvard’s history of $125M from Hansjörg Wyss and five years to prove our model before the funds ran out, so we were eager to start, and as it turned out, so was everyone <span class="txt-wrap">else.<sup><a href="#fn26" id="r26" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">26</a></sup></span></p> <p>I was at Boston Children’s Hospital for years before founding the Wyss Institute, so I knew that partnering with hospitals in the area would be absolutely critical, and my existing relationships gave us a head start. We were proposing to bring engineering to the heart of the Longwood Medical Area, and that was a new experience for the hospitals, so they were very keen on getting involved.</p> <p>We learned a great deal in our discussions from the previous agreements the hospitals had with other research centers. We took note of worked well for them, and made changes to better suit the translational focus of our partnerships. </p> <p>For example, one of the biggest barriers to commercial collaboration is managing intellectual property and sharing revenues. Anytime two institutions want to collaborate on a commercial project, they have to draft a new agreement to manage the rights and royalties arising from that collaboration, which takes a long time.</p> <p>So we decided to create a single governing agreement that applies to any partner who joins. Anytime the agreement is modified, the changes apply to everyone. By doing that, we eliminated the need for side agreements, which are often a big source of misalignment.</p> <p>Another area where misalignment can creep in is faculty appointment. There, the model we went with gave each partner the right to one faculty member at the Wyss Institute, and required greater budget contributions for sending us additional faculty. And that turned out to be a very effective way to ensure that the growth of our faculty remains balanced and justified.</p> <p>Once all the pieces were in place, forging new partnerships became easier, and we were free to pursue new collaborations anywhere in the world based on the common interests of our faculty. </p> <p>Having committed partners also had a tremendous impact on our startups. Every startup has to focus very intently and be diligent with its capital, and we can stretch how far every penny goes by marshaling the combined resources of the Wyss Institute, Harvard University, and all of our partners.</p> <p>We help our startups validate their products, use capital-intensive labs and equipment at our sites, tap into our existing intellectual property, and call in the expert help of our faculty to assist with thorny technical problems.</p> <p>The firm foundation on which we set our partnerships has also helped us ensure that our collaborations always remain honest and intense, and those are the two components you need if you want to build anything greater than the sum of its parts.</p> <div class="footnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn25"> <p>David Walt joined the Wyss Institute in 2017.
