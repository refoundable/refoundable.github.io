It was simply a given that you had to understand the spatial relationship between molecules as well as their biochemistry.</p> <p>Things changed when I got to graduate medical school. I was surprised to find that molecular mechanics was swept aside and that cell biology became solely focused on the study and manipulation of biochemistry.</p> <p>Then, everything changed again when gene cloning arrived. Instead of messing around with individual molecules, now you could look for the genetic sequence controlling the expression of this or that molecule and switch it on/off. This appealed to molecular biologists because it made getting experimental results much easier.</p> <p>Biology journals like <em>Cell</em> even held meetings for journalists at the time to explain the changes sweeping through the field. This was the dawn of a new era, they said, where genetics would be the key to unlock the secrets of biology, a perspective that remains dominant today.</p> <p>Despite these tectonic shifts, I decided to go a different way and try to investigate an idea that was deemed heretical at the time, namely that mechanical forces could be as important as chemical and genes to the regulation of biology. I’d arrived to this hypothesis by a circuitous route that began early during my time at Yale.</p> <p>My first clue was in a developmental biology class where we watched the earliest timelapse footage to come out at the time of embryos in development. I could see the cells divide and get smaller and smaller, then start to pull on each other and sculpt the various organs from the embryo, and something about the whole process struck me as being more than just chemicals and genes, and irreducibly physical.</p> <figure> <video class="inl-vid" id="vid-1" height="100%" autoplay="" muted="" src="/assets/video/buf.mp4" data-echo="/assets/video/res-int-ingber-1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <figcaption id="vid-cap-res-int-ingber-1">Timelapse of a zebrafish embryo undergoing cell division and early organ formation.&nbsp;<span class="credits credits-inl">Phoebe Grigg</span></figcaption> <div class="replay-btn-wrapper"> <button type="button" class="replay-btn-text" id="replay-btn-1" onclick="replayVideo(&quot;vid-1&quot;)">Replay<svg class="replay-btn-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 50 59"><defs></defs><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M25.13 15H25a19 19 0 1019 19h6A25 25 0 1125.27 9L20.9 3.96 25.4.02l10.5 12.08-.44.38-10.31 11.45-4.46-4.01L25.13 15z"></path></svg></button> </div> </figure> <p>The second important clue came sometime later, and it has a long and serendipitous story. It began one day when I&nbsp;noticed some students on campus carrying sculptures made from cardboard, that looked to me like viruses I’d seen in biology books, and I found out that they all came from one sculpture class on three dimensional design taught by Erwin Hauer.</p> <p>At the time, art classes were notoriously difficult to get into, especially for a science student, but I managed to get an interview with professor Hauer to explain why I was trying to take his class. “Three dimensional design is everywhere in biology” I said, and began listing every example I could think of until he’d heard enough and finally decided to invite me to join his class.</p> <p>I was enthralled by the course as a whole, but there was one particular class that would end up changing my entire scientific career. That day, professor Hauer came in with a challenge. He wanted every student to build a structure that can hold its shape using only wooden struts and fishing strings we had on hand. And before he left, he added one final condition: “the wood struts cannot touch.”</p> <p>For a while, we were hopelessly lost, but soon one student figured out how to build one of these structures, and then the rest of us caught up. The trick was to connect the struts using the strings in such a way that you create enough tension to hold the structure together.</p> <figure> <video class="ful-vid" id="vid-2" height="100%" autoplay="" muted="" src="/assets/video/buf.mp4" data-echo="/assets/video/res-int-ingber-2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <figcaption id="vid-cap-res-int-ingber-2">Wooden struts push out against a network of elastic strings, putting each structure in a state of isometric tension called prestress that holds it together even under extreme shock.&nbsp;<span class="credits credits-inl">Joseph Arnold</span></figcaption> <div class="replay-btn-wrapper"> <button type="button" class="replay-btn-text" id="replay-btn-2" onclick="replayVideo(&quot;vid-2&quot;)">Replay<svg class="replay-btn-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 50 59"><defs></defs><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M25.13 15H25a19 19 0 1019 19h6A25 25 0 1125.27 9L20.9 3.96 25.4.02l10.5 12.08-.44.38-10.31 11.45-4.46-4.01L25.13 15z"></path></svg></button> </div> </figure> <p>When professor Hauer came back later, he gave a slide lecture on the architecture behind the structures we built, and this was the moment when I first learned about “tensegrity,” a stand-in term for “tensional integrity” that was coined by Buckminster <span class="txt-wrap">Fuller.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">1</a></sup></span></p> <p>The professor also took out a small sphere built from struts and elastic strings and placed it on his desk. When he pressed down on it with the palm of his hand, it flattened like a pancake, but when he lifted up his hand, it bounced right back into shape.</p> <p>This was remarkable to be sure, but I didn’t yet know what to make of it when I headed, later that week, to the lab on the other side of campus to learn how to culture cancer cells for the first time.</p> <p>When you place cells in a petri dish, the first thing you would notice is that cells like to stretch out and attach themselves to the surface. So when you need to transfer them to another petri dish, you have to add a chemical enzyme that loosens the anchors keeping them sticking to the surface before you try to pick them up.</p> <p>We added the enzyme to prepare the cells for transfer, and to my great surprise, the cells that were flat as a pancake all of sudden rounded up like an elastic stress ball, so I said the first thing that came to my mind: “Oh, the tensegrity must have changed!”</p> <figure> <video class="inl-vid" id="vid-3" height="100%" autoplay="" muted="" src="/assets/video/buf.mp4" data-echo="/assets/video/res-int-ingber-3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <figcaption id="vid-cap-res-int-ingber-3">When a chemical enzyme releases the anchors keeping cells attached to the surface, they quickly round up.&nbsp;<span class="credits credits-blk">Don Ingber</span></figcaption> <div class="replay-btn-wrapper"> <button type="button" class="replay-btn-text" id="replay-btn-3" onclick="replayVideo(&quot;vid-3&quot;)">Replay<svg class="replay-btn-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 50 59"><defs></defs><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M25.13 15H25a19 19 0 1019 19h6A25 25 0 1125.27 9L20.9 3.96 25.4.02l10.5 12.08-.44.38-10.31 11.45-4.46-4.01L25.13 15z"></path></svg></button> </div> </figure> <p>Back then, people still thought of cells as balloons filled with molasses, so my comment didn’t make much sense to the postdoc in charge, and when I explained that I learned about tensegrity in a sculpture class, he told me to never say that word again.</p> <p>Afterwards, I went to the science library to look for answers. The first papers to discuss the shape of cells were recently published, and I got to learn about a structure supporting the cell called the cytoskeleton. This was an encouraging sign because if the cytoskeleton was acting like a spring or a muscle, then that would account for the way the cells were stretching and rounding up.</p> <p>Over at the art library, I also learned about the serious discussions that went on in the mid-1960s about structuralism. In a major anthology titled <em>Structure in Art and in Science</em>, a number of scientists, designers, artists, and architects like Fuller argued that uncovering the secrets of any complex system isn’t achieved by looking at each element by itself, but by seeing how all the elements are arranged <span class="txt-wrap">together.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">2</a></sup></span></p> <p>This idea was immediately relevant to the question I had. I knew from molecular biophysics that when you change the biochemistry of a cell, its gene expression can also change given that the two are connected. I began to wonder if a change to the mechanical force applied on a cell might likewise lead its biochemistry and gene expression to change as <span class="txt-wrap">well.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">3</a></sup></span></p> <p>What began as a small observation was now something far bigger, and I realized that if I could prove it, then tensegrity would provide a theory by which to explain potentially how the physical structures of all living organisms are built.</p> <p>This was, at the highest level, what I set out to do with my PhD thesis in 1984. And I also built a physical tensegrity model of the cell and nucleus that explained how the two always manage to stay in synchrony thanks to the mechanical link betweeen <span class="txt-wrap">them.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="r4" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">4</a></sup></span></p> <p>This was, at the highest level, what I set out to do with my PhD thesis in 1984. My focus was on cell biology, so I built a physical tensegrity model of the cell and nucleus and showed that it could accurately explain how the two manage to syncrhonize their behavior thanks to a mechanical link that keeps them coupled together.</p> <p>Most of the big ideas I wrote about in my thesis became everything I’ve worked on ever since, because even at that point, all the big questions were clear, and with the benefit of hindsight, I would say that this was certainly the beginning of the rest of my life.</p> <figure> <img class="ful-img" alt="The tensegrity model of the cell and nucleus is exhibited at the Martin-Gropius-Bau Museum in Berlin in 2016." id="img-res-int-ingber-1" src="/assets/img/buf.png" data-echo="/assets/img/res-int-ingber-1.jpg"> <figcaption id="img-cap-res-int-ingber-1">The tensegrity model of the cell and nucleus Ingber built for his doctoral thesis.

Electrophoresis and other existing methods were not very good at this, so I also had to come up with new ways to control the geometry of the cell.</p> <p>The first idea I had was to use small magnetic beads to pull on the cell receptors, and I got a few engineers to help me find the ideal magnetic particles to match the nanosize of the receptors. The experiment was a big success, and we showed that pulling on special receptors called integrins could activate signaling pathways on the surface of the cell and even turn on gene transcription inside <span class="txt-wrap">it.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="r5" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">5</a></sup></span></p> <p>For the next experiment, I wanted to have control over the shape of the entire cell using mechanical force alone. This was achieved by growing cells on microscopic islands of varying sizes and shapes, surrounded by areas on which cells couldn’t grow. By controlling the shape and size of each island, we controlled the shape of the cells as they grew. <sup style="padding-top:35vh;margin-top:-35vh"><a href="#ed" id="ed" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">E</a></sup></p> <p>That led us to make a surprising discovery. We found that the shape of a cell affected its function and even its fate. When a cell grew too large, it started dividing more frequently, but when a cell couldn’t grow at all, it activated a suicide program called apostasis and died. And between these two extremes, cells grew and differentiated <span class="txt-wrap">normally.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="r6" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">6</a></sup></span></p> <p>Many of the techniques we used for this experiment came out of the chemistry lab of George Whitesides at Harvard. George had developed a low-cost method of making microchips, and upon learning about this, I realized that microchip manufacturing offered control over features of the same scale as cells and tissues. So George and I began a very fruitful collaboration, publishing a series of papers <span class="txt-wrap">together.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="r7" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">7</a></sup></span></p> <p>Later on, George started making chips with tiny hollow channels that liquids could flow through, which looked like artificial blood vessels to me.

One paper received positive peer reviews recommending to accept it with minor revisions and it was still turned down. When I appealed to the journal saying we could easily make the minor revisions, the sole answer I received from the editors was that it was journal policy to allow only one response to reviewer comments and “you just used it.”</p> <p>To this day, the term tensegrity is not used. All the other concepts like prestress and cell shape have become an accepted part of biology, but they will not use that word. I was once even told explicitly by a program manager at the NIH that they’d be ready to fund my grant requests if only I would take that word out.</p> <p>I never compromised. Early in my career, I had a formative experience working as a postdoc with Judah Folkman and I saw first-hand how he was publicly criticized for his research on tumor angiogenesis in major outlets like <em>Science</em>, <em>Time Magazine</em>, and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. I was already quite independent, but seeing everything Dr. Folkman endured made me all the more determined to <span class="txt-wrap">persevere.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="r11" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">11</a></sup></span></p> <p>Once, we submitted a paper to <em>Science</em> on the discovery of a fungus-derived drug that inhibited angiogenesis, and sure enough, the journal turned it down. To mark the occasion, Judah handed me a book about the discovery of penicillin, another fungi-derived drug, and he turned to a page that showed the letter Alexander Fleming received from the editors of <em>Nature</em> in 1929 dismissing his discovery as a curiosity for the specialty <span class="txt-wrap">journals.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="r12" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">12</a></sup></span></p> <p>“There are no experts of the future,” Dr. Folkman used to say. Thomas Kuhn even went as far as to write that you have to wait for your critics to die. Mechanobiology has been slowly gaining ground over the last 20–30 years as young students came in with open minds, but for me personally, the journey to get here has taken the last 45 years.</p> <p class="qst" id="q4">Although your work has been published in high impact journals, you're critical of peer-reviewed publication.

People are posting their results on the web, and within a few days or weeks, others are either confirming the results or showing them to be unrepeatable. The discussion feels dynamic and the science is zooming ahead.</p> <p>Sadly, that’s far from the way things typically work. A single paper usually takes years of revisions and delays to be published, and nearly anything can jeopardize it along the way. An editor may deem it unfit for their journal. Or they might assign your interdisciplinary work to a narrow specialist for review, or worse, to a competing scientist with a conflict of interest, on and on. You end up forced to go from journal to journal until you find a lucky match with one editor and two reviewers.</p> <p>More and more onerous demands are also placed on scientists looking to publish in high impact journals. When I started out, a typical <em>Science</em> or <em>Nature</em> paper had a handful of pictures and one or two graphs. Now, the supplementary material alone is 15–20 figures, and that’s on top of what’s already in the paper.</p> <p>That’s five papers’ worth of data for a single article. And putting those datasets together might take 2–3 years. Not only does that badly hold up the advance of science, to say nothing of the all time and money it eats up, but the worst part is that it unfairly punishes young scientists as they can never get their papers out in a timely way in order to land a good job.</p> <p>Some have reacted to this by only publishing in specialty journals and avoiding high impact journals altogether, but that only works if you’re trying to reach a narrow audience of experts, not when you’re making breakthroughs that can have a wide range of applications.</p> <p>It’s also not surprising that scientists are increasingly publishing their papers on bioRxiv or medRxiv, where you can quickly share your latest findings, then turn around and cite your paper in a grant or a follow-up study. As more science gets put out there, the inevitable question for review journals will be: what’s <span class="txt-wrap">left?<sup><a href="#fn13" id="r13" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">13</a></sup></span></p> <p>Peer review is no guarantee. High impact journals have published their share of papers that later turned out to be wrong. They’ve also missed plenty of seminal papers over the years. The ultimate test of value for any scentific paper, no matter where it gets published, will always be whether other scientists can repeat its results, or better yet, build on them.</p> <p>For the time being, review journals remain an important tool for career advancement. Any scientist looking for a job, a grant, or a promotion, if not for them then for their students, has no choice but to compete for a spot in a high impact journal. That won’t change until we revisit how scientists are hired and fired.</p> <p class="qst" id="q5">Your prolific efforts to promote Mechanobiology brought attention to the nascent field. How essential is publicity to the work of a scientist? And what other factors did also fuel the growth of the field?<a class="qst-lnk" href="#q5"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a></p> <p>I learned early on that science is really a sermon on the mount. People don’t get excited until they hear you speak, then they go back and look you up afterwards, which is why meeting other scientists is important. Few will admit this, but making a good impression on a fellow scientist can sometimes make a big difference to whether or not they end up trusting your work. It’s a people business.</p> <p>The rise of bioengineering over the course of the last 20–30 years also helped mechanobiology because students began to take engineering courses alongside biology, and mechanics is a big part of engineering. That introduced a whole generation of students to the concepts they need to know come into the field.</p> <p>the quality of the tools also did xyz.</p> <p>Nevertheless, science is a very conservative business, and to this day mechanobiology is still a small corner of biology while most scientists are happy doing what they’ve always done for the last fifty years.</p> <p>On the other hand, that leaves young students with more to discover. I&nbsp;try to teach my students that anytime you want to put forward a new scientific idea, you have to be prepared to defend it in three ways:</p> <p>First, you have to learn how to play by the rules of those who control the present paradigm, and show that you can use their tools and get their results. Second, you need to develop new tools that enable you to have rigorous control over the important variables others don’t even see. And third, you must be ready to explain phenomena others can’t explain. Everything I’ve done in science is in these three points.</p> <div class="footnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn1"> <p>Tensegrity is an architectural system in which a structure is stabilized by balancing the counteracting forces of tension and compression.

We called this approach “biologically inspired engineering” in contrast to bioengineering which uses engineering principles to do XYZ.</p> <p>At launch, we had 14 founding faculty members with a broad range of expertise and interests across biology, clinical medicine, most engineering fields, chemistry, computer science, robotics, and more. We decided to organize our research efforts around a few major focus areas at the intersection of many disciplines, such as living cellular devices, synthetic biology, molecular robotics, and others.</p> <p>Each focus area was led by a core faculty, and brought together faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and technical staff to develop new tools, methods, and materials that can drive the next wave of innovations.</p> <figure> <img class="ful-img" alt="Tiny flying robots with insect wings" id="img-res-int-ingber-5" src="/assets/img/buf.png" data-echo="/assets/img/res-int-ingber-5.jpg"> <figcaption id="img-cap-res-int-ingber-5">Inspired by the biology of a fly, these robotic insects achieve vertical takeoff, hovering, and steering thanks to two wafer-thin wings that flap at 120 times per second.

Instead, when a core faculty has a visionary idea for a new area, we give them the means to try it. Sometimes that means asking the heads of other areas to take a small budget cut, but we’ve never had an issue because the faculty understand better than anyone that new focus areas benefit the Institute as a&nbsp;whole.</p> <p>For example, when David Walt joined as a core faculty, he had a vision for a “diagnostics accelerator” that would identify the unmet needs of clinicians, find new technologies that meet those needs, and accelerate their translation into the <span class="txt-wrap">clinic.<sup><a href="#fn26" id="r26" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">26</a></sup></span></p> <p>We turned that vision into a Wyss Institute initiative led by Walt with the collaboration of his lab at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, and that initative is allowing us to validate our technologies with hard clinical data, and work closer to clinicians than ever before.</p> <p class="qst" id="q13">The Wyss Institute tries to combine the novelty of academic research with the practicality of industry. Why is the integration important?<a class="qst-lnk" href="#q13"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a></p> <p>Mature companies face a classic innovator’s dilemma. When they have to choose between betting the company on a risky idea or doubling down on their success, most will choose the latter.</p> <p>Meanwhile, academia can generate a wealth of creative ideas, but it doesn’t have the focus to see the most promising ones turned into useful applications. Academic researchers are not trained to patent the technologies they invent, and their career advancement is not linked to their success at reducing innovation to practice.</p> <p>At the Wyss Institute, we expect all our researchers to write reports of inventions as early in the development phase as possible. The reports go to an intellectual property attorney on site who reviews every one and offers feedback to focus the investigators’ research efforts on the path most likely to lead to valuable new patents.</p> <p>Another problem plaguing the academy is that publicly-funded grants often go to support incremental advances in science while the boldest ideas rarely get the support they need. As a result, it’s not uncommon to see researchers working on their most exciting ideas in their spare time between different grant projects.</p> <p>So when we started the Wyss Institute, we recruited faculty members who had done lots of interdisciplinary work in spite of the system, and we structured the Institute to turbocharge their work by removing any hurdles in the way.</p> <p>For example, we don’t ask our faculty to give up their lab at their home institution when they join us. In fact, we want them to keep their independent culture and simply move their most entrepreneurial postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and research assistants to the Institute where they can work on problems that can only be solved through an interdisciplinary effort.</p> <p>We make collaboration easier by having all of our faculty members and staff in one large open lab, allowing experts from different disciplines, who normally have no reason to work together, to start talking to each other and organically form new interdisciplinary teams.</p> <p>We also provide a sophisticated machine shop staffed by experienced full-time engineers, something you won’t find in most medical schools or academic labs. It houses a versatile set of manufacturing tools that enable us to prototype and build almost any type of device, from a soft robot down to a living microchip, and choose from a wide range of materials, many of which are approved by the FDA for use in medical applications.</p> <p>In addition, we recruited 40 technical staff scientists and engineers to join the Wyss Institute from industry. Each brings years to decades of product development experience from companies like AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKlein, Pfizer, Biogen, iRobot, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and Procter &amp; Gamble among others.</p> <p>Technical staff are not a new addition to research centers, but while they’re usually assigned to run the research facilities, we prefer to bring them into our development teams.</p> <p>The result is, for example, that when one of our scientists goes looking for a material that has particular physical properties, the answer might come from one of our technical staff who encountered a material with similar properties under a very different setting.</p> <p>When you combine that with the experience of our technical staff in setting timelines and meeting milestones, you get a dramatic boost to our development teams’ ability to reduce innovation to practice, and do so at a pace rarely seen in academia.</p> <p class="qst" id="q14">Being too early to market is always a risk when working with cutting-edge research.

Likewise, when we brought in entrepreneurs-in-residence, they were also quick to talk to venture capitalists.</p> <p>After seeing a number of these early discussions, we realized that we could triangulate what investors and companies needed to close the deal, so we launched a program called “Institute Projects.”</p> <p>We asked every development team to turn the feedback they got from investors and industry into a plan that outlined how the technology should be developed further to warrant venture capital funding and increase the likelihood of commercial success.</p> <p>Qualified teams could request funds from the Institute to recruit entrepreneurs-in-residence with expertise in the field, and to carry out late-stage validation efforts, like reducing manufacturing costs, demonstrating buy-in from clinicians, conducting a regulatory and market analysis, and running phase I clinical trials.</p> <p>The program was a great success, but we soon realized that there was a void between the early research and Institute Projects, so to bridge that gap, we started a second program called “Validation Projects.”</p> <p>There, the goal was to identify promising technologies in our pipeline that have been refined enough to be ready for development based on a set of technical, legal, and commercial criteria. Teams that qualified then worked on de-risking the technology and validating its applicability and market potential.</p> <p>With that, we had a complete technology translation funnel that moved from complete creative freedom in the early research phase to a well-defined roadmap by the time you got to the commercialization phase.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the funnel is not a rigid formula and the details will vary from case to case. For example, with organs-on-chips, it was DARPA’s non-dilutive $37M grant that carried the technology across the entire funnel, and that was a clear sign of an idea whose time had come.</p> <p class="qst" id="q15">The Wyss Institute coordinates with a dozen different partners, from academic institutions to hospitals, to take innovations out of the lab.

Four months before we opened our doors in January 2009, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Eight billion dollars of Harvard’s endowment vanished. Hospitals were extremely worried. And amid this chaos, we had the biggest gift in Harvard’s history of $125M from Hansjörg Wyss and five years to prove our model before the funds ran out, so we were eager to start, and as it turned out, so was everyone <span class="txt-wrap">else.<sup><a href="#fn27" id="r27" class="fn-btn fn-btn-top">27</a></sup></span></p> <p>I was at Boston Children’s Hospital for years before founding the Wyss Institute, so I knew that partnering with hospitals in the area would be absolutely critical, and my existing relationships gave us a head start. We were proposing to bring engineering to the heart of the Longwood Medical Area, and that was a new experience for the hospitals, so they were very keen on getting involved.</p> <p>We learned a great deal in our discussions from the previous agreements the hospitals had with other research centers. We took note of worked well for them, and made changes to better suit the translational focus of our partnerships. </p> <p>For example, one of the biggest barriers to commercial collaboration is managing intellectual property and sharing revenues. Anytime two institutions want to collaborate on a commercial project, they have to draft a new agreement to manage the rights and royalties arising from that collaboration, which takes a long time.</p> <p>So we decided to create a single governing agreement that applies to any partner who joins. Anytime the agreement is modified, the changes apply to everyone. By doing that, we eliminated the need for side agreements, which are often a big source of misalignment.</p> <p>Another area where misalignment can creep in is faculty appointment. There, the model we went with gave each partner the right to one faculty member at the Wyss Institute, and required greater budget contributions for sending us additional faculty. And that turned out to be a very effective way to ensure that the growth of our faculty remains balanced and justified.</p> <p>Once all the pieces were in place, forging new partnerships became easier, and we were free to pursue new collaborations anywhere in the world based on the common interests of our faculty. </p> <p>Having committed partners also had a tremendous impact on our startups. Every startup has to focus very intently and be diligent with its capital, and we can stretch how far every penny goes by marshaling the combined resources of the Wyss Institute, Harvard University, and all of our partners.</p> <p>We help our startups validate their products, use capital-intensive labs and equipment at our sites, tap into our existing intellectual property, and call in the expert help of our faculty to assist with thorny technical problems.</p> <p>The firm foundation on which we set our partnerships has also helped us ensure that our collaborations always remain honest and intense, and those are the two components you need if you want to build anything greater than the sum of its parts.</p> <div class="footnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn26"> <p>David Walt joined the Wyss Institute in 2017.
